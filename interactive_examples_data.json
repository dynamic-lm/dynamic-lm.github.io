          "value": "On a circle, there are $N$ equally spaced points numbered $0,1,\\ldots,N-1$ in this order, with Alice at point $0$ and Bob at point $K$. Initially, all points are colored white. Starting with Alice, they alternately perform the following operation:\n\n- Choose one of the currently white points and color it black. Here, after the operation, the coloring of the points must be symmetric with respect to the straight line connecting the operator and the center of the circle.\n\nIf the operator cannot perform an operation satisfying the above condition, the sequence of operations ends there.\nBoth players cooperate and make the best choices to maximize the total number of points colored black in the end. Determine whether all points are colored black at the end of the sequence of operations.\nYou are given $T$ test cases to solve.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n$T$\n$\\mathrm{case}_1$\n$\\mathrm{case}_2$\n$\\vdots$\n$\\mathrm{case}_T$\n\nEach test case $\\mathrm{case}_i (1 \\leq i \\leq T)$ is in the following format:\n$N \\ \\ K$\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint $T$ lines.

Actually, no matter what they do, they cannot color all points black.\n\n- Alice colors point 3 black.\n- Bob colors point 0 black.\n- Alice cannot color any point black so that the coloring will be symmetric with respect to her line, so she cannot perform the operation."

So, points 0 and 3 are on the axis.\n        # Similarly, for Bob's initial position (K), the axis is through K and the center. The points on this axis are those that are symmetric to themselves with respect to this line. For example, K and (2K - K) mod N = K. So, the axis for Bob includes K and its opposite point (if N is even).\n        # But during the game, the players can only color points that are on their respective axes. However, the process must allow for all points to be colored. So, the problem reduces to whether the players can color all points by choosing points in such a way that the symmetry condition is met.\n        # Another observation: The game ends when a player cannot make a move. So, the game ends when all possible symmetric pairs are colored. But the players are trying to maximize the number of colored points. So, the game ends when all points are colored, or when no more moves can be made.\n        # The question is whether all points can be colored. So, for that to happen, the total number of points must be even? Or perhaps there's a condition based on the positions of Alice and Bob.\n        # Let's think of the case where N is even. Let's say N is even. Then, there is a point opposite to Alice's position (0), which is N/2. Similarly for Bob's position K, the opposite point is (2K) mod N.\n        # Let's think about the sample input where N=6, K=2. The answer is Yes. So, the total number of points is 6. How can all be colored?\n        # The process involves each move adding one point. So, the total number of moves is 6. Since Alice starts, the number of moves is 6. So, Alice makes 3 moves, Bob makes 3 moves. But how?\n        # The key might be whether the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry is even. Or perhaps the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry.\n        # Alternatively, perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even, and the players can pair them up.\n        # Another idea: For the entire process to end with all points colored, the initial positions must allow for all points to be colored. This happens when the players can pair up all the points in such a way that each move colors one point (since the symmetric is already there). But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the problem as a game where each move colors exactly one point (the symmetric is already there). The total number of moves is N. But since players alternate, the number of moves must be N, and the players must be able to make all moves. So, the parity of N must allow for that. But this is not directly helpful.\n        # Let's think of the problem in terms of the number of points that are on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob. For example, if Alice and Bob's axes are the same, then the game can proceed. Otherwise, perhaps not.\n        # Let's think about the case where K is 0. But the problem states that K is between 1 and N-1. So, K is not 0.\n        # Another approach: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even. Or perhaps the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for the initial positions.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even. But I'm not sure.\n        # Let's think of the sample input N=6, K=2. The axis for Alice is through 0 and 3. The axis for Bob is through 2 and 4 (since 2*2=4 mod 6). So, the points on Alice's axis are 0 and 3. On Bob's axis are 2 and 4. The other points are 1, 5. These points are not on either axis. So, how are they colored?\n        # For example, when Alice colors 3 (on her axis), then Bob can color 1 (which is symmetric to 5 with respect to his axis). But how? Wait, when Bob colors 1, the symmetric of 1 with respect to his axis is (2*2 -1) mod 6 = 3. Which is already colored. So, the set {3, 1} is symmetric with respect to Bob's axis. So, Bob can color 1. Then, Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric to 1 with respect to Alice's axis?), or something else. Wait, Alice's axis is through 0 and 3. The symmetric of 5 with respect to Alice's axis is (2*0 -5) mod 6 = (0-5) mod 6 = 1. So, if Alice colors 5, then the symmetric is 1, which is already colored. So, she can color 5. Then, the set includes 3, 1, 5. Then Bob's turn. He can color 2 (on his axis), and then Alice can color 0. Then Bob can color 4. Then all points are colored. So, this works.\n        # The key seems to be that the number of points not on the axes of Alice and Bob must be even. But how to determine that?\n        # Let's think about the number of points that are not on the axes of Alice and Bob. For Alice's axis, the points on it are those that are symmetric to themselves with respect to her line. Similarly for Bob's axis. But during the game, the players are allowed to color points on their axes. So, the total number of points that can be colored is the sum of the points on Alice's axis and Bob's axis, but this seems not helpful.\n        # Another idea: For the entire circle to be colored, the number of points that are not on the axis of either player must be even. Because each such point must be paired with its symmetric counterpart. But how does this relate to Alice and Bob's initial positions?\n        # Let's think about the initial positions. Alice starts at 0, Bob at K. The game proceeds with each player coloring points in a way that maintains symmetry. The key is that for the entire circle to be colored, the players must be able to color all points. This is possible if and only if the initial positions allow for all points to be paired in such a way that the players can choose them.\n        # Another observation: The game ends when all points are colored, or when no more moves can be made. For all points to be colored, the players must be able to make all moves. This requires that the number of points that can be colored is N. Which depends on the positions of Alice and Bob.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of either player. For example, if there are an even number of such points, they can be paired up. But how?\n        # Perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob. Let's say that the axis of Alice is A and the axis of Bob is B. The number of points not on either axis must be even. But I'm not sure.\n        # Let's think of the sample input N=6, K=2. The points not on Alice's axis (0 and 3) are 1,2,4,5. The points not on Bob's axis (2 and 4) are 0,1,3,5. So the points not on either axis are 1 and 5. Which is even. So, this is possible.\n        # For the sample input N=6, K=3. The axis for Alice is 0 and 3. Bob's axis is through 3 and the center. So, the axis for Bob includes 3 and (2*3 -3) mod 6 = 3. So, Bob's axis is 3. So, the points on Alice's axis are 0 and 3. The points on Bob's axis are 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. Which is even. But the sample output is No. So this idea is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that my previous approach is not correct. So, I need to think differently.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of moves. Since each move colors one point, the total number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, the number of moves is N. So, if N is even, Alice and Bob each make N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other makes (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions? For example, in the case where N=6 and K=3, the sample output is No. Let's think why.\n        # In this case, Alice starts at 0, Bob at 3. The axis for Alice is 0 and 3. The axis for Bob is 3 and the center. So, Bob's axis includes 3. So, the initial positions are on the same axis. So, Alice can color 0 or 3. Let's say she colors 3. Then, Bob can color 3 (but it's already colored). So, he can't. Or, he can color other points on his axis. But his axis is 3. So, he can only color 3. But it's already colored. So, Bob can't move. So the game ends with only one point colored. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the key is whether the initial positions allow for the players to make moves. For example, if Alice and Bob are on the same axis, then the initial move by Alice can color a point on the axis, and Bob may have no moves.\n        # So, the condition for all points to be colored is that the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves until all points are colored.\n        # Let's think of the following: For the entire process to end with all points colored, the initial positions must be such that the number of points that can be colored is N, and the players can alternate making moves. This depends on the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of the players.\n        # Another idea: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions allow for the players to take turns coloring those points.\n        # But I'm not making progress. Let's look for a pattern in the sample inputs.\n        # Sample Input 1:\n        # 4\n        # 6 2 \u2192 Yes\n        # 6 3 \u2192 No\n        # 6 1 \u2192 Yes\n        # 200000 100000 \u2192 No\n        # For N=6, K=2: Yes\n        # For N=6, K=3: No\n        # For N=6, K=1: Yes\n        # Let's think about the cases where K is 0 (but it's not allowed). Let's think for K=1 (N=6). Alice's axis is 0 and 3. Bob's axis is through 1 and the center. The points on Bob's axis are 1 and (2*1 -1) mod 6 = 1. So, the axis includes 1. So, the points not on Alice's axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. The points not on Bob's axis are 0, 2, 3, 5. The intersection of these is 2 and 5. Which is even. So, why is the answer Yes?\n        # Let's think of the process. Alice starts by coloring 3 (on her axis). Bob can color 1 (on his axis). Then Alice can color 5 (symmetric to 1 with respect to her axis? Or symmetric to 5 with respect to her axis. Let's see: For Alice's axis (through 0 and 3), the symmetric of 5 is (2*0 -5) mod 6 = 1. So, if Alice colors 5, the symmetric is 1, which is already colored. So, she can. Then Bob can color 2 (symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -2) mod 6 = 0. Which is not colored. Wait, no. Bob's axis is through 1. So, the symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 - 2) mod 6 = 0. So, if Bob colors 2, then the symmetric is 0, which is not colored. So, he can't. So, this seems to be a problem. How does the sample input for N=6, K=1 have a Yes answer?\n        # Perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think of the sample input for N=6, K=1. The sample output is Yes. According to the explanation, it's possible to color all points. Let's think of the steps:\n        # Alice's first move: color 3 (on her axis). Now, the set is {3}.\n        # Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color a point on his axis, which is 1. So, he colors 1. Now, the set is {3, 1}.\n        # Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric of 1 with respect to her axis is 1, which is already there. Wait, no. The symmetric of 1 with respect to Alice's axis is (2*0 -1) mod 6 = 5. So, if Alice colors 5, then the symmetric is 1, which is already in the set. So, she can do that. Now the set is {3,1,5}.\n        # Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color a point on his axis. The points on his axis are 1 and (2*1 -1) mod 6 = 1. So, he can only color 1, which is already colored. So, he can't. So, the game ends with 3 points colored. But the sample says it's Yes. So, this suggests that there's another way to proceed.\n        # Let's think again. Maybe Alice's first move is to color 0. Then the set is {0}. Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color 1 (on his axis). Now the set is {0,1}. Alice's turn. She can choose to color 3 (on her axis). Now the set is {0,1,3}. Bob's turn. He can choose to color 2 (symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -2) mod 6 = 0. Which is already in the set. So, he can color 2. Now the set is {0,1,3,2}. Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric of 1 is 5, which is already in the set). So, she colors 5. Now the set is {0,1,3,2,5}. Bob's turn. He can color 4 (symmetric of 4 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -4) mod 6 = (2-4) mod 6 = 4. So, 4 is on his axis. So, he can color 4. Now all points are colored. So, this works.\n        # So, the key is that the players can choose to color points on their axis, and the symmetric of those points may be already colored. So, the process can proceed.\n        # So, the question is how to determine for given N and K whether this is possible.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. But how?\n        # Another observation: For all points to be colored, the players must be able to color all points in pairs, where each pair consists of a point and its symmetric. But this depends on the initial positions.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry of either player. For example, if N is even, and K is such that the axis of Bob is the same as Alice's, then the number of points not on the axis is even. But this is not clear.\n        # Another approach: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the initial positions of Alice and Bob are such that the number of points that are not on their axes is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # Alternatively, think about the following: The game is a variant of the game where each move adds a point and its symmetric. So, the total number of points that can be colored is N. For this to be possible, the number of points that can be colored must be even or odd based on the players' turns.\n        # Let's think about the number of points that are on the axis of Alice and Bob. Let's say that the number of points on Alice's axis is a, and on Bob's axis is b. But this may overlap. For example, if Alice and Bob's axes are the same, then a and b may overlap.\n        # But this is getting too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the following: For the entire process to end with all points colored, the number of points that can be colored by the players must be N. This requires that the players can alternate making moves until all points are colored. This is possible if and only if the initial positions allow for this.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game is possible if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can take turns coloring them.\n        # But how to calculate this?\n        # Let's think of the number of points that are on the axis of Alice and Bob. For Alice's axis, the number of points is 2 if N is even (0 and N/2), or 1 if N is odd (only 0). Similarly for Bob's axis. But this depends on K.\n        # For example, if N is even, and K is N/2, then Bob's axis is through N/2 and the center. So, the axis includes N/2 and the point opposite to it, which is N/2 again (since it's on the center). So, the axis has only one point, N/2.\n        # This is getting too complex. Perhaps the solution is based on whether the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions allow for the players to take turns.\n        # Let's think of the sample input N=6, K=3. Alice's axis is through 0 and 3. Bob's axis is through 3. So, the points on the axes are 0,3 (Alice's) and 3 (Bob's). So, the points not on the axes are 1,2,4,5. These are 4 points, which is even. But the sample output is No. So, this suggests that the number of points not on the axes being even is not sufficient.\n        # So, what's the difference between N=6, K=2 and N=6, K=3? In the first case, the players can alternate making moves, but in the second case, they can't. Let's think about the initial positions.\n        # For N=6, K=3: Alice is at 0, Bob at 3. Alice's axis includes 0 and 3. Bob's axis includes 3. So, when Alice starts, she can choose to color 0 or 3. Let's say she colors 3. Now, Bob's turn. He can only color points on his axis, which is 3. But it's already colored. So, Bob cannot move. Hence, the game ends with only one point colored. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the key is whether the players can make moves. For the game to end with all points colored, the players must be able to alternate making moves until all points are colored. This requires that the number of points that can be colored is N, and that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions allow for the players to take turns.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # Another observation: For the game to end with all points colored, the players must be able to make all the moves. This requires that the number of moves is N. Since each move adds exactly one point, the number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, the number of moves is N, which means that if N is even, both players make N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions?\n        # Let's think of the initial positions. For example, if Alice and Bob are on the same axis, then the first move by Alice can be to color a point on the axis. Then, Bob has to color a point on his axis, which is the same as Alice's axis. But if the axis has only one point (e.g., N is even and K is N/2), then Bob may not have any moves.\n        # So, the key seems to be whether the initial positions allow for the players to make all the required moves. This depends on whether the number of points on the axes of Alice and Bob is sufficient to allow for the players to alternate.\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are on the axis of Alice and Bob is a + b - c, where a is the number of points on Alice's axis, b on Bob's, and c is the intersection. For the game to proceed, the players must have enough points on their axes to make the required moves.\n        # But this is still too vague.\n        # Let's think of the following condition: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the number of points not on either axis is 4 (even), but the answer is No. So, this condition is not sufficient.\n        # Let's try to find a pattern in the sample inputs.\n        # Sample input 1: N=6, K=2 \u2192 Yes\n        # N=6, K=3 \u2192 No\n        # N=6, K=1 \u2192 Yes\n        # N=200000, K=100000 \u2192 No\n        # For N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. For K=3, it's No. For K=1, it's Yes. For K=100000, it's No.\n        # Let's think about the parity of K. For N=6, K=2 is even, K=3 is odd, K=1 is odd. The answer for K=2 is Yes, for K=3 is No, for K=1 is Yes.\n        # For N=200000, K=100000 is N/2. The answer is No.\n        # So, perhaps the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. But for N=6, K=3 is N/2, and the answer is No. For N=6, K=2 is not N/2, and the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1 is not N/2, and the answer is Yes. For N=200000, K=100000 is N/2, and the answer is No. So this seems to fit.\n        # What about other cases? For example, N=4, K=1. Let's see:\n        # N=4, K=1. Alice's axis is through 0 and 2. Bob's axis is through 1 and 3. The points not on either axis are none. So, all points are on the axes. So, the players can alternate making moves. Let's see:\n        # Alice colors 0. Bob colors 1. Alice colors 2. Bob colors 3. All points are colored. So, the answer is Yes.\n        # For N=4, K=2 (N/2), the answer is No. Because Alice colors 0, Bob can only color 2 (which is already on his axis). But then he can't move. So, the answer is No.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. But wait, for N=6, K=3 is N/2 and the answer is No. For N=4, K=2 is N/2 and the answer is No. But for N=6, K=1 is not N/2 and the answer is Yes. So, this seems to fit.\n        # What about N=6, K=2? K is not N/2. The answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, answer is No. For N=6, K=4 (which is N/2 + 2), the answer would be Yes? Let's see. N=6, K=4. Bob is at 4. His axis is through 4 and the center. The axis includes 4 and (2*4 -4) mod 6 = 4. So, the axis includes 4. Alice's axis is 0 and 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Wait, 5 is not on either axis. Let's see: For Alice's axis, 0 and 3. For Bob's axis, 4. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Which is odd. So, the answer would be No. But according to the previous pattern, K=4 is not N/2, so the answer should be Yes. This contradicts the pattern.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is not simply whether K is equal to N/2.\n        # Let's think of another pattern. The sample inputs suggest that when K is equal to N/2, the answer is No. Otherwise, it's Yes. But this is not the case for N=6, K=1, which is not N/2 and the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=2, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3 (N/2), answer is No. For N=6, K=4 (which is N/2 + 2), the answer would be Yes or No?\n        # Let's think about N=6, K=4. Bob is at 4. His axis is through 4 and the center. So, the points on his axis are 4 and (2*4 -4) mod 6 = 4. So, only 4. Alice's axis is 0 and 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Which is odd. So, it's impossible to pair them. So, the answer would be No. But according to the previous pattern, since K is not N/2, the answer is Yes. This contradicts the pattern. So, the pattern is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that the condition is more complex. Perhaps the correct condition is that the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # But how to calculate this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of Alice or Bob is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # For Alice's axis, the number of points on it is 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. For Bob's axis, it's 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. But this depends on K.\n        # For example, if N is even, and K is not N/2, then Bob's axis has 2 points. So, the points on Alice's axis are 2, and on Bob's axis are 2. The intersection is 0 if K is not N/2. So, the total number of points on either axis is 2 + 2 - 0 = 4. The total number of points not on either axis is N - 4. For N=6, this is 6-4=2, which is even. So, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3 (N/2), the points on Alice's axis are 2, and on Bob's axis are 1 (since K is N/2, the axis has only 1 point). So, the total number of points on either axis is 2 + 1 - 1 = 2. The number of points not on either axis is 6-2=4, which is even. But the sample input for N=6, K=3 is No. So, this suggests that the condition is not sufficient.\n        # This is getting too complex. Perhaps the solution is to check if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions allow for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # But I'm stuck. Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions allow for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the number of points not on either axis is 4 (even), but the answer is No. So, this condition is not sufficient. What's different in this case?\n        # In this case, Alice's axis includes 0 and 3, and Bob's axis includes 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. But how can the players color these points?\n        # Let's try to simulate. Alice colors 0 (on her axis). Bob can color 3 (on his axis). Now, the set is {0, 3}. Alice's turn. She can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, no move. The game ends. So, the answer is No.\n        # So, the problem is that the initial moves by the players may not allow for all points to be colored, even if the number of points not on the axes is even.\n        # This suggests that the condition is not just about the number of points not on the axes, but also about the initial positions allowing for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # Perhaps the correct condition is that the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can make moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can take turns making moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. This allows for the players to pair them up. But the players must be able to alternate making moves. This depends on the initial positions.\n        # For example, if the initial positions are such that the players can make moves, then it's possible.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions are not on the same axis.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the initial positions are on the same axis (3 is on both Alice's and Bob's axis). So, the answer is No. For N=6, K=2, the initial positions are not on the same axis. So, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, the initial positions are not on the same axis. So, the answer is Yes. For N=200000, K=100000 (N/2), the initial positions are on the same axis. So, the answer is No.\n        # This seems to fit the sample inputs. Let's test this hypothesis.\n        # For N=6, K=3: initial positions are on the same axis (3). So, answer is No.\n        # For N=6, K=2: initial positions are not on the same axis. So, answer is Yes.\n        # For N=6, K=1: initial positions are not on the same axis. So, answer is Yes.\n        # For N=200000, K=100000: initial positions are on the same axis.

Answer is No.\n        # N=4, K=3: initial positions are not on the same axis. Answer is Yes.\n        # So, this hypothesis seems to fit. The condition is that the initial positions are not on the same axis. How to determine this?\n        # The initial positions are on the same axis if and only if K is on Alice's axis. Alice's axis is through 0 and the center. The points on this axis are 0 and N/2 if N is even. So, for K to be on Alice's axis, K must be 0 or N/2. But K is between 1 and N-1, so K can be N/2. So, for K to be on Alice's axis, it must be N/2.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, then the initial positions are on the same axis, and the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2), the answer is No. For N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, it's No.\n        # But what about N=4, K=2 (N/2), the answer is No. For N=4, K=1, the answer is Yes.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, then the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But this seems to fit the sample inputs. Let's check the sample input for N=6, K=1. K is not N/2, so answer is Yes. For N=6, K=2, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, answer is No. For N=200000, K=100000 (N/2), answer is No. So, this seems to fit.\n        # But what about N=4, K=2 (N/2), answer is No. For N=4, K=1, answer is Yes. For N=4, K=3, answer is Yes.\n        # Let's test another case: N=8, K=4 (N/2). Answer is No. For N=8, K=2, answer is Yes.\n        # This seems to fit. So, the condition is: the answer is Yes if and only if K is not equal to N/2.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2) \u2192 No. N=6, K=1 \u2192 Yes. N=6, K=2 \u2192 Yes. N=6, K=3 \u2192 No. This fits.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3, which is N/2. The answer is No. But what if N is even and K is not N/2? The answer is Yes.\n        # So, the solution is to check if K is equal to N/2. If it is, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2), and the players can make moves? Let's think. For example, Alice colors 0. Bob colors 3. Now, the set is {0,3}. Alice's turn. She can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, no move. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the condition is that if K is equal to N/2, then the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But what about N=4, K=1. N/2 is 2.

Answer is No. Correct.\n        # So, this seems to be the correct condition. But why?\n        # Because when K is equal to N/2, Alice and Bob are on the same axis. Alice starts, and she can color a point on the axis. Bob can color the same point (which is already colored). So, he cannot make a move. Hence, the game ends early.\n        # So, the solution is to check if K is equal to N/2. If yes, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3. N is even, K is N/2. Output No.\n        # What about N=4, K=2. Output No.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3. What if Alice colors 3 first? Then Bob can color 3 again? No, it's already colored. So, no move. Hence, answer is No.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, output No. Else, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3. N is even, K is N/2. Output No.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3. Let's think of another scenario. Alice colors 0. Bob colors 3. Then, Alice can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). No move. So, answer is No.\n        # So, this condition seems to be correct.\n        # Now, let's check the sample input for N=6, K=1. K is not N/2. Output is Yes. Correct.\n        # So, the code can be written as follows: For each test case, if N is even and K is equal to N/2, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # Wait, but what about when N is odd? For example, N=5, K=2. N is odd. N/2 is 2.5. So, K cannot be N/2. So, the answer is Yes.\n        # For N=5, K=2. Alice's axis is through 0 and the center (but since N is odd, there is no point opposite to 0. So, the axis for Alice is only 0. Bob's axis is through K=2 and the center. So, the points on Bob's axis are 2 and (2*2 -2) mod 5 = 2. So, only 2. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 3, 4. Which is odd. So, the answer would be No. But according to the condition, since K is not N/2 (N=5, N/2 is 2.5), the answer is Yes. This contradicts.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is not correct.\n        # For N=5, K=2. According to the previous condition, since K is not equal to N/2 (which is not an integer), the answer is Yes. But according to the simulation, it might not be possible.\n        # Let's simulate N=5, K=2. Alice starts at 0, Bob at 2.\n        # Alice's axis is through 0 and the center. For N=5, the axis includes 0 and the center. But since N is odd, there is no point opposite to 0. So, the axis for Alice includes only 0.\n        # Bob's axis is through 2 and the center. So, the points on his axis are 2 and (2*2 - 2) mod 5 = 2. So, only 2.\n        # So, the points not on either axis are 1, 3, 4. Which is 3 points, odd. So, it's impossible to pair them. Hence, the answer should be No.\n        # But according to the previous condition, since K is not N/2, the answer is Yes. This is a contradiction.\n        # So, the previous condition is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that the condition is more complex. It seems that the condition is not simply whether K is equal to N/2.\n        # At this point, I'm stuck and need to find another approach.\n        # Let's think about the problem from a different angle. The game is a variant of the game where each move colors a point and its symmetric. The players alternate, and the goal is to maximize the number of colored points. The question is whether all points can be colored.\n        # For all points to be colored, the number of points must be even? Or odd?\n        # Let's think: For all points to be colored, the total number of moves must be N. Since each move adds exactly one point, the number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, if N is even, each player makes N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other makes (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions?\n        # The key is whether the players can make all moves. For this, the players must be able to choose points on their axes, and the symmetric of those points must be already colored.\n        # Let's think about the following: For all points to be colored, the initial positions must allow for the players to alternate making moves until all points are colored. This is possible if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the players can alternate making moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. For example, in N=6, K=2, this number is 4 (even). In N=5, K=2, this number is 3 (odd), so it's impossible.\n        # So, the condition is that the number of points not on the axis of either player is even.\n        # Let's calculate this number. The number of points on Alice's axis is 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. For Bob's axis, it's 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. The intersection of these two axes is 1 if K is on Alice's axis, or 0 otherwise.\n        # So, the number of points on either axis is:\n        # For N even:\n        # Alice's axis has 2 points.\n        # Bob's axis has 2 points.\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (i.e., K is 0 or N/2), then the intersection is 1 point. So, total points on either axis is 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.\n        # Otherwise, the intersection is 0, so total is 2 + 2 = 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # Alice's axis has 1 point.\n        # Bob's axis has 1 point.\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (which is only possible if K=0, but K is between 1 and N-1), so it's not possible. So, the intersection is 0. Total is 1 + 1 = 2.\n        # So, the number of points not on either axis is N - (number on either axis).\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K=0 or N/2), then number of points on either axis is 3. So, N - 3.\n        # If K is not on Alice's axis, then number of points on either axis is 4. So, N - 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # Number of points on either axis is 2. So, N - 2.\n        # So, the number of points not on either axis is:\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis: N - 3.\n        # Else: N - 4.\n        # For N odd: N - 2.\n        # For all points to be colored, this number must be even.\n        # Let's check this with the sample inputs.\n        # Sample input 1: N=6 (even), K=2 (not on Alice's axis). N-4 = 6-4=2 (even). So, answer is Yes.\n        # Sample input 2: N=6, K=3 (on Alice's axis). N-3=6-3=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # Sample input 3: N=6, K=1 (not on Alice's axis). N-4=2 (even). Answer is Yes.\n        # Sample input 4: N=200000 (even), K=100000 (on Alice's axis). N-3=200000-3=199997 (odd). Answer is No.\n        # For N=5 (odd), K=2. N-2=5-2=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # This fits with the previous example. So, the condition is that the number of points not on either axis is even.\n        # So, the steps to determine the answer are:\n        # 1. For each test case, calculate the number of points not on either axis.\n        # 2. If this number is even, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n        # Now, how to calculate this number.\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K is 0 or N/2), then the number of points not on either axis is N - 3.\n        # Else, it's N - 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # The number of points not on either axis is N - 2.\n        # So, for N odd, the number is N-2. For this to be even, N-2 must be even \u2192 N must be even. But N is odd, so N-2 is odd. So, for N odd, the number of points not on either axis is odd, so the answer is No.\n        # Wait, this suggests that for N odd, the answer is always No. But this contradicts the earlier example where N=5, K=2. Let's see:\n        # For N=5 (odd), the number of points not on either axis is 5-2=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # But what about N=5, K=2. Can the players color all points?\n        # Let's try to simulate:\n        # Alice starts at 0. She can color 0 (on her axis). Bob's axis is through 2. He can color 2. Now, the set is {0, 2}. Alice's turn. She can color points on her axis (0 is already colored). So, no move. The game ends. So, answer is No. So, the condition is correct.\n        # So, for N odd, the number of points not on either axis is N-2, which is odd. So, the answer is No.\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K=0 or N/2), then the number of points not on either axis is N-3. This must be even.\n        # So, N-3 must be even \u2192 N must be odd. But N is even, so N-3 is odd. So, for N even and K on Alice's axis, the number is odd. So, answer is No.\n        # Else, for N even and K not on Alice's axis, the number is N-4. This must be even \u2192 N-4 must be even \u2192 N must be even. So, for N even and K not on Alice's axis, the number is even. So, answer is Yes.\n        # So, the overall conditions are:\n        # - If N is odd: answer is No.\n        # - If N is even:\n        #   - If K is equal to N/2 or 0 (but K is between 1 and N-1, so K=0 is not possible), then answer is No.\n        #   - Else, answer is Yes.\n        # But wait, for N even, K is between 1 and N-1.

This is equivalent to finding the number of **perfect matchings** in the graph formed by the 24-gon, with the constraint that all edges (segments) must have the same length.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- A **perfect matching** in a graph is a set of edges that cover all vertices exactly once.\n- In a regular polygon, the **length of a chord** between two vertices depends on the **step size** $ k $, which is the number of vertices skipped when moving from one to the other.\n- The **maximum step size** in a 24-gon is $ k = 12 $, as beyond that, the chords become equivalent in length due to the polygon's symmetry.\n- For a given step size $ k $, the connections form **cycles** of vertices. The number and length of these cycles determine whether a perfect matching is possible and how many such matchings exist.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\nFor each step size $ k = 1 $ to $ 12 $, we:\n1. Determine the number of **cycles** formed by connecting each vertex to the one $ k $ steps away.\n2. For each cycle, count the number of **perfect matchings** that can be formed using only the edges of that cycle.\n3. Multiply the number of perfect matchings for each cycle to get the total number of perfect matchings for that step size.\n4. Sum over all valid step sizes to get the **total number of perfect matchings** with all edges of equal length.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Count:\n\n| Step Size $ k $ | Cycle Structure | Number of Cycles | Perfect Matchings per Cycle | Total for $ k $ |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| 1                | One cycle of 24  | 1                | 2                           | 2                |\n| 2                | Two cycles of 12 | 2                | 2                           | 4                |\n| 3                | Three cycles of 8 | 3               | 2                           | 8                |\n| 4                | Four cycles of 6 | 4                | 2                           | 16               |\n| 5                | One cycle of 24  | 1                | 2                           | 2                |\n| 6                | Six cycles of 4  | 6                | 2                           | 64               |\n| 7                | One cycle of 24  | 1                | 2                           | 2                |\n| 8                | Eight cycles of 3| 8                | 0 (odd length)              | 0                |\n| 9                | Three cycles of 8 | 3               | 2                           | 8                |\n| 10               | Two cycles of 12 | 2                | 2                           | 4                |\n| 11               | One cycle of 24  | 1                | 2                           | 2                |\n| 12               | Twelve cycles of 2 | 12             | 1 (each is a single edge)   | 1                |\n\n---\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\nAdding all the perfect matchings from the above table:\n\n$$\n2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 2 + 64 + 2 + 0 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = \\boxed{113}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe total number of ways to draw 12 segments of equal length in a regular 24-gon such that each vertex is an endpoint of exactly one segment is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{113}\n$$"

            "value": "To solve the problem, we are given a regular 24-gon with vertices labeled $ S = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{24}\\} $. We are to find the number of ways to draw **12 segments** such that:\n\n- Each segment connects **two vertices**,\n- All segments have **equal length**,\n- Each vertex is the **endpoint of exactly one segment** (i.e., the segments form a **perfect matching** of the 24 vertices).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Structure\n\nIn a regular 24-gon, the length of a chord between two vertices depends on how many steps apart they are along the perimeter. For a regular polygon with $ n $ sides, the number of distinct chord lengths (excluding the side length) is $ \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor $. In our case, $ n = 24 $, so the possible **distinct chord lengths** are determined by the number of steps $ k $, where $ k = 1, 2, \\ldots, 12 $.\n\nEach such chord connects a vertex $ v_i $ to $ v_{i+k} $ (modulo 24). The key is that we want a **perfect matching** using **only one type of chord length**, i.e., only one value of $ k $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Conditions for a Perfect Matching\n\nA perfect matching of a graph is a set of edges that:\n\n- Covers all the vertices,\n- No two edges share a vertex.\n\nFor a perfect matching to be formed by connecting vertices with a fixed step $ k $, the following must hold:\n\n- The number of vertices must be even (which it is, since 24 is even),\n- The step $ k $ must be such that the resulting graph (i.e., the graph with only edges of length $ k $) can be partitioned into disjoint edges (i.e., it must be a union of disjoint cycles or paths, and each cycle must have even length to allow a perfect matching).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Each Step Size $ k $\n\nLet\u2019s analyze for each $ k = 1 $ to $ 12 $, whether it is possible to form a perfect matching using only edges of step $ k $.\n\n#### Case $ k = 1 $:\n- Each vertex is connected to its immediate neighbor.\n- This creates a single cycle of length 24.\n- A cycle of length 24 can be decomposed into 2 perfect matchings (alternating edges).\n- However, **each edge must be of the same length**, and in this case, all edges are of step 1.\n- So, **one perfect matching** can be formed by selecting every other edge in this cycle.\n\n#### Case $ k = 2 $:\n- Connecting each vertex to the one 2 steps away.\n- This creates **two disjoint cycles**, each of length 12.\n- Each cycle of length 12 can be decomposed into **2 perfect matchings**.\n- So, total number of perfect matchings = $ 2 \\times 2 = 4 $.\n\n#### Case $ k = 3 $:\n- Connecting each vertex to the one 3 steps away.\n- This creates **three disjoint cycles**, each of length 8.\n- Each cycle of length 8 has **2 perfect matchings**.\n- So, total number of perfect matchings = $ 2^3 = 8 $.\n\n#### Case $ k = 4 $:\n- Connecting each vertex to the one 4 steps away.\n- This creates **6 disjoint cycles**, each of length 4.\n- Each cycle of length 4 has **2 perfect matchings**.\n- So, total number of perfect matchings = $ 2^6 = 64 $.\n\n#### Case $ k = 5 $:\n- Connecting each vertex to the one 5 steps away.\n- This is equivalent to $ k = 24 - 5 = 19 $, which is the same as connecting to the vertex 5 steps in the **opposite direction**.\n- The structure is the same as $ k = 19 $, which is equivalent to $ k = 5 $ (since 24 - 5 = 19).\n- So, the number of perfect matchings is the same as for $ k = 19 $, which is **same as for $ k = 5 $**.\n- So, **same as for $ k = 5 $**.\n\n#### Case $ k = 6 $:\n- Connecting each vertex to the one 6 steps away.\n- This creates **4 disjoint cycles**, each of length 6.\n- Each cycle of length 6 has **2 perfect matchings**.\n- So, total number of perfect matchings = $ 2^4 = 16 $.\n\n#### Case $ k = 7 $:\n- Equivalent to $ k = 17 $, which is the same as $ k = 7 $.\n- The structure is the same as $ k = 7 $, so same number of perfect matchings.\n\n#### Case $ k = 8 $:\n- Equivalent to $ k = 16 $, which is the same as $ k = 8 $.\n- This creates **3 disjoint cycles**, each of length 8.\n- So, same as $ k = 3 $, which gives **8 perfect matchings**.\n\n#### Case $ k = 9 $:\n- Equivalent to $ k = 15 $, which is the same as $ k = 9 $.\n- This creates **2 disjoint cycles**, each of length 12.\n- So, same as $ k = 2 $, which gives **4 perfect matchings**.\n\n#### Case $ k = 10 $:\n- Equivalent to $ k = 14 $, which is the same as $ k = 10 $.\n- This creates **1 disjoint cycle**, of length 24.\n- So, same as $ k = 1 $, which gives **1 perfect matching**.\n\n#### Case $ k = 11 $:\n- Equivalent to $ k = 13 $, which is the same as $ k = 11 $.\n- This creates **2 disjoint cycles**, each of length 12.\n- So, same as $ k = 2 $, which gives **4 perfect matchings**.\n\n#### Case $ k = 12 $:\n- Each vertex is connected to its **opposite vertex**.\n- This creates **12 disjoint edges** (each vertex is paired with its opposite).\n- So, **only one perfect matching** is possible.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Summing Up the Total\n\nNow, we sum the number of perfect matchings for each valid $ k $ (from 1 to 12), noting that some values of $ k $ are equivalent (e.g., $ k = 1 $ and $ k = 23 $, etc.) and we only count each distinct configuration once.\n\nWe have:\n\n- $ k = 1 $: 1\n- $ k = 2 $: 4\n- $ k = 3 $: 8\n- $ k = 4 $: 64\n- $ k = 5 $: 8\n- $ k = 6 $: 16\n- $ k = 7 $: 8\n- $ k = 8 $: 8\n- $ k = 9 $: 4\n- $ k = 10 $: 1\n- $ k = 11 $: 4\n- $ k = 12 $: 1\n\nNow summing these:\n\n$$\n1 + 4 + 8 + 64 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{124}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{124}\n$$"
