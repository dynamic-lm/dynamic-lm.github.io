Starting with Alice, they alternately perform the following operation:\n\n- Choose one of the currently white points and color it black. Here, after the operation, the coloring of the points must be symmetric with respect to the straight line connecting the operator and the center of the circle.\n\nIf the operator cannot perform an operation satisfying the above condition, the sequence of operations ends there.\nBoth players cooperate and make the best choices to maximize the total number of points colored black in the end. Determine whether all points are colored black at the end of the sequence of operations.\nYou are given $T$ test cases to solve.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\n$T$\n$\\mathrm{case}_1$\n$\\mathrm{case}_2$\n$\\vdots$\n$\\mathrm{case}_T$\n\nEach test case $\\mathrm{case}_i (1 \\leq i \\leq T)$ is in the following format:\n$N \\ \\ K$\n\n**Output**\n\nPrint $T$ lines.

So, points 0 and 3 are on the axis.\n        # Similarly, for Bob's initial position (K), the axis is through K and the center. The points on this axis are those that are symmetric to themselves with respect to this line. For example, K and (2K - K) mod N = K. So, the axis for Bob includes K and its opposite point (if N is even).\n        # But during the game, the players can only color points that are on their respective axes. However, the process must allow for all points to be colored. So, the problem reduces to whether the players can color all points by choosing points in such a way that the symmetry condition is met.\n        # Another observation: The game ends when a player cannot make a move. So, the game ends when all possible symmetric pairs are colored. But the players are trying to maximize the number of colored points. So, the game ends when all points are colored, or when no more moves can be made.\n        # The question is whether all points can be colored. So, for that to happen, the total number of points must be even? Or perhaps there's a condition based on the positions of Alice and Bob.\n        # Let's think of the case where N is even. Let's say N is even. Then, there is a point opposite to Alice's position (0), which is N/2. Similarly for Bob's position K, the opposite point is (2K) mod N.\n        # Let's think about the sample input where N=6, K=2. The answer is Yes. So, the total number of points is 6. How can all be colored?\n        # The process involves each move adding one point. So, the total number of moves is 6. Since Alice starts, the number of moves is 6. So, Alice makes 3 moves, Bob makes 3 moves. But how?\n        # The key might be whether the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry is even. Or perhaps the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry.\n        # Alternatively, perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even, and the players can pair them up.\n        # Another idea: For the entire process to end with all points colored, the initial positions must allow for all points to be colored. This happens when the players can pair up all the points in such a way that each move colors one point (since the symmetric is already there). But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the problem as a game where each move colors exactly one point (the symmetric is already there). The total number of moves is N. But since players alternate, the number of moves must be N, and the players must be able to make all moves. So, the parity of N must allow for that. But this is not directly helpful.\n        # Let's think of the problem in terms of the number of points that are on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob. For example, if Alice and Bob's axes are the same, then the game can proceed. Otherwise, perhaps not.\n        # Let's think about the case where K is 0. But the problem states that K is between 1 and N-1. So, K is not 0.\n        # Another approach: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even. Or perhaps the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for the initial positions.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even. But I'm not sure.\n        # Let's think of the sample input N=6, K=2. The axis for Alice is through 0 and 3. The axis for Bob is through 2 and 4 (since 2*2=4 mod 6). So, the points on Alice's axis are 0 and 3. On Bob's axis are 2 and 4. The other points are 1, 5. These points are not on either axis. So, how are they colored?\n        # For example, when Alice colors 3 (on her axis), then Bob can color 1 (which is symmetric to 5 with respect to his axis). But how? Wait, when Bob colors 1, the symmetric of 1 with respect to his axis is (2*2 -1) mod 6 = 3. Which is already colored. So, the set {3, 1} is symmetric with respect to Bob's axis. So, Bob can color 1. Then, Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric to 1 with respect to Alice's axis?), or something else. Wait, Alice's axis is through 0 and 3. The symmetric of 5 with respect to Alice's axis is (2*0 -5) mod 6 = (0-5) mod 6 = 1. So, if Alice colors 5, then the symmetric is 1, which is already colored. So, she can color 5. Then, the set includes 3, 1, 5. Then Bob's turn. He can color 2 (on his axis), and then Alice can color 0. Then Bob can color 4. Then all points are colored. So, this works.\n        # The key seems to be that the number of points not on the axes of Alice and Bob must be even. But how to determine that?\n        # Let's think about the number of points that are not on the axes of Alice and Bob. For Alice's axis, the points on it are those that are symmetric to themselves with respect to her line. Similarly for Bob's axis. But during the game, the players are allowed to color points on their axes. So, the total number of points that can be colored is the sum of the points on Alice's axis and Bob's axis, but this seems not helpful.\n        # Another idea: For the entire circle to be colored, the number of points that are not on the axis of either player must be even. Because each such point must be paired with its symmetric counterpart. But how does this relate to Alice and Bob's initial positions?\n        # Let's think about the initial positions. Alice starts at 0, Bob at K. The game proceeds with each player coloring points in a way that maintains symmetry. The key is that for the entire circle to be colored, the players must be able to color all points. This is possible if and only if the initial positions allow for all points to be paired in such a way that the players can choose them.\n        # Another observation: The game ends when all points are colored, or when no more moves can be made. For all points to be colored, the players must be able to make all moves. This requires that the number of points that can be colored is N. Which depends on the positions of Alice and Bob.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of either player. For example, if there are an even number of such points, they can be paired up. But how?\n        # Perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry for Alice and Bob. Let's say that the axis of Alice is A and the axis of Bob is B. The number of points not on either axis must be even. But I'm not sure.\n        # Let's think of the sample input N=6, K=2. The points not on Alice's axis (0 and 3) are 1,2,4,5. The points not on Bob's axis (2 and 4) are 0,1,3,5. So the points not on either axis are 1 and 5. Which is even. So, this is possible.\n        # For the sample input N=6, K=3. The axis for Alice is 0 and 3. Bob's axis is through 3 and the center. So, the axis for Bob includes 3 and (2*3 -3) mod 6 = 3. So, Bob's axis is 3. So, the points on Alice's axis are 0 and 3. The points on Bob's axis are 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. Which is even. But the sample output is No. So this idea is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that my previous approach is not correct. So, I need to think differently.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of moves. Since each move colors one point, the total number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, the number of moves is N. So, if N is even, Alice and Bob each make N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other makes (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions? For example, in the case where N=6 and K=3, the sample output is No. Let's think why.\n        # In this case, Alice starts at 0, Bob at 3. The axis for Alice is 0 and 3. The axis for Bob is 3 and the center. So, Bob's axis includes 3. So, the initial positions are on the same axis. So, Alice can color 0 or 3. Let's say she colors 3. Then, Bob can color 3 (but it's already colored). So, he can't. Or, he can color other points on his axis. But his axis is 3. So, he can only color 3. But it's already colored. So, Bob can't move. So the game ends with only one point colored. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the key is whether the initial positions allow for the players to make moves. For example, if Alice and Bob are on the same axis, then the initial move by Alice can color a point on the axis, and Bob may have no moves.\n        # So, the condition for all points to be colored is that the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves until all points are colored.\n        # Let's think of the following: For the entire process to end with all points colored, the initial positions must be such that the number of points that can be colored is N, and the players can alternate making moves. This depends on the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of the players.\n        # Another idea: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions allow for the players to take turns coloring those points.\n        # But I'm not making progress. Let's look for a pattern in the sample inputs.\n        # Sample Input 1:\n        # 4\n        # 6 2 \u2192 Yes\n        # 6 3 \u2192 No\n        # 6 1 \u2192 Yes\n        # 200000 100000 \u2192 No\n        # For N=6, K=2: Yes\n        # For N=6, K=3: No\n        # For N=6, K=1: Yes\n        # Let's think about the cases where K is 0 (but it's not allowed). Let's think for K=1 (N=6). Alice's axis is 0 and 3. Bob's axis is through 1 and the center. The points on Bob's axis are 1 and (2*1 -1) mod 6 = 1. So, the axis includes 1. So, the points not on Alice's axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. The points not on Bob's axis are 0, 2, 3, 5. The intersection of these is 2 and 5. Which is even. So, why is the answer Yes?\n        # Let's think of the process. Alice starts by coloring 3 (on her axis). Bob can color 1 (on his axis). Then Alice can color 5 (symmetric to 1 with respect to her axis? Or symmetric to 5 with respect to her axis. Let's see: For Alice's axis (through 0 and 3), the symmetric of 5 is (2*0 -5) mod 6 = 1. So, if Alice colors 5, the symmetric is 1, which is already colored. So, she can. Then Bob can color 2 (symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -2) mod 6 = 0. Which is not colored. Wait, no. Bob's axis is through 1. So, the symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 - 2) mod 6 = 0. So, if Bob colors 2, then the symmetric is 0, which is not colored. So, he can't. So, this seems to be a problem. How does the sample input for N=6, K=1 have a Yes answer?\n        # Perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think of the sample input for N=6, K=1. The sample output is Yes. According to the explanation, it's possible to color all points. Let's think of the steps:\n        # Alice's first move: color 3 (on her axis). Now, the set is {3}.\n        # Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color a point on his axis, which is 1. So, he colors 1. Now, the set is {3, 1}.\n        # Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric of 1 with respect to her axis is 1, which is already there. Wait, no. The symmetric of 1 with respect to Alice's axis is (2*0 -1) mod 6 = 5. So, if Alice colors 5, then the symmetric is 1, which is already in the set. So, she can do that. Now the set is {3,1,5}.\n        # Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color a point on his axis. The points on his axis are 1 and (2*1 -1) mod 6 = 1. So, he can only color 1, which is already colored. So, he can't. So, the game ends with 3 points colored. But the sample says it's Yes. So, this suggests that there's another way to proceed.\n        # Let's think again. Maybe Alice's first move is to color 0. Then the set is {0}. Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color 1 (on his axis). Now the set is {0,1}. Alice's turn. She can choose to color 3 (on her axis). Now the set is {0,1,3}. Bob's turn. He can choose to color 2 (symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -2) mod 6 = 0. Which is already in the set. So, he can color 2. Now the set is {0,1,3,2}. Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric of 1 is 5, which is already in the set). So, she colors 5. Now the set is {0,1,3,2,5}. Bob's turn. He can color 4 (symmetric of 4 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -4) mod 6 = (2-4) mod 6 = 4. So, 4 is on his axis. So, he can color 4. Now all points are colored. So, this works.\n        # So, the key is that the players can choose to color points on their axis, and the symmetric of those points may be already colored. So, the process can proceed.\n        # So, the question is how to determine for given N and K whether this is possible.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. But how?\n        # Another observation: For all points to be colored, the players must be able to color all points in pairs, where each pair consists of a point and its symmetric. But this depends on the initial positions.\n        # Let's think about the parity of the number of points that are not on the axis of symmetry of either player. For example, if N is even, and K is such that the axis of Bob is the same as Alice's, then the number of points not on the axis is even. But this is not clear.\n        # Another approach: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the initial positions of Alice and Bob are such that the number of points that are not on their axes is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # Alternatively, think about the following: The game is a variant of the game where each move adds a point and its symmetric. So, the total number of points that can be colored is N. For this to be possible, the number of points that can be colored must be even or odd based on the players' turns.\n        # Let's think about the number of points that are on the axis of Alice and Bob. Let's say that the number of points on Alice's axis is a, and on Bob's axis is b. But this may overlap. For example, if Alice and Bob's axes are the same, then a and b may overlap.\n        # But this is getting too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the following: For the entire process to end with all points colored, the number of points that can be colored by the players must be N. This requires that the players can alternate making moves until all points are colored. This is possible if and only if the initial positions allow for this.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game is possible if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can take turns coloring them.\n        # But how to calculate this?\n        # Let's think of the number of points that are on the axis of Alice and Bob. For Alice's axis, the number of points is 2 if N is even (0 and N/2), or 1 if N is odd (only 0). Similarly for Bob's axis. But this depends on K.\n        # For example, if N is even, and K is N/2, then Bob's axis is through N/2 and the center. So, the axis includes N/2 and the point opposite to it, which is N/2 again (since it's on the center). So, the axis has only one point, N/2.\n        # This is getting too complex. Perhaps the solution is based on whether the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions allow for the players to take turns.\n        # Let's think of the sample input N=6, K=3. Alice's axis is through 0 and 3. Bob's axis is through 3. So, the points on the axes are 0,3 (Alice's) and 3 (Bob's). So, the points not on the axes are 1,2,4,5. These are 4 points, which is even. But the sample output is No. So, this suggests that the number of points not on the axes being even is not sufficient.\n        # So, what's the difference between N=6, K=2 and N=6, K=3? In the first case, the players can alternate making moves, but in the second case, they can't. Let's think about the initial positions.\n        # For N=6, K=3: Alice is at 0, Bob at 3. Alice's axis includes 0 and 3. Bob's axis includes 3. So, when Alice starts, she can choose to color 0 or 3. Let's say she colors 3. Now, Bob's turn. He can only color points on his axis, which is 3. But it's already colored. So, Bob cannot move. Hence, the game ends with only one point colored. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the key is whether the players can make moves. For the game to end with all points colored, the players must be able to alternate making moves until all points are colored. This requires that the number of points that can be colored is N, and that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions allow for the players to take turns.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Perhaps the answer is \"Yes\" if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # Another observation: For the game to end with all points colored, the players must be able to make all the moves. This requires that the number of moves is N. Since each move adds exactly one point, the number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, the number of moves is N, which means that if N is even, both players make N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions?\n        # Let's think of the initial positions. For example, if Alice and Bob are on the same axis, then the first move by Alice can be to color a point on the axis. Then, Bob has to color a point on his axis, which is the same as Alice's axis. But if the axis has only one point (e.g., N is even and K is N/2), then Bob may not have any moves.\n        # So, the key seems to be whether the initial positions allow for the players to make all the required moves. This depends on whether the number of points on the axes of Alice and Bob is sufficient to allow for the players to alternate.\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are on the axis of Alice and Bob is a + b - c, where a is the number of points on Alice's axis, b on Bob's, and c is the intersection. For the game to proceed, the players must have enough points on their axes to make the required moves.\n        # But this is still too vague.\n        # Let's think of the following condition: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the number of points not on either axis is 4 (even), but the answer is No. So, this condition is not sufficient.\n        # Let's try to find a pattern in the sample inputs.\n        # Sample input 1: N=6, K=2 \u2192 Yes\n        # N=6, K=3 \u2192 No\n        # N=6, K=1 \u2192 Yes\n        # N=200000, K=100000 \u2192 No\n        # For N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. For K=3, it's No. For K=1, it's Yes. For K=100000, it's No.\n        # Let's think about the parity of K. For N=6, K=2 is even, K=3 is odd, K=1 is odd. The answer for K=2 is Yes, for K=3 is No, for K=1 is Yes.\n        # For N=200000, K=100000 is N/2. The answer is No.\n        # So, perhaps the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. But for N=6, K=3 is N/2, and the answer is No. For N=6, K=2 is not N/2, and the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1 is not N/2, and the answer is Yes. For N=200000, K=100000 is N/2, and the answer is No. So this seems to fit.\n        # What about other cases? For example, N=4, K=1. Let's see:\n        # N=4, K=1. Alice's axis is through 0 and 2. Bob's axis is through 1 and 3. The points not on either axis are none. So, all points are on the axes. So, the players can alternate making moves. Let's see:\n        # Alice colors 0. Bob colors 1. Alice colors 2. Bob colors 3. All points are colored. So, the answer is Yes.\n        # For N=4, K=2 (N/2), the answer is No. Because Alice colors 0, Bob can only color 2 (which is already on his axis). But then he can't move. So, the answer is No.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. But wait, for N=6, K=3 is N/2 and the answer is No. For N=4, K=2 is N/2 and the answer is No. But for N=6, K=1 is not N/2 and the answer is Yes. So, this seems to fit.\n        # What about N=6, K=2? K is not N/2. The answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, answer is No. For N=6, K=4 (which is N/2 + 2), the answer would be Yes? Let's see. N=6, K=4. Bob is at 4. His axis is through 4 and the center. The axis includes 4 and (2*4 -4) mod 6 = 4. So, the axis includes 4. Alice's axis is 0 and 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Wait, 5 is not on either axis. Let's see: For Alice's axis, 0 and 3. For Bob's axis, 4. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Which is odd. So, the answer would be No. But according to the previous pattern, K=4 is not N/2, so the answer should be Yes. This contradicts the pattern.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is not simply whether K is equal to N/2.\n        # Let's think of another pattern. The sample inputs suggest that when K is equal to N/2, the answer is No. Otherwise, it's Yes. But this is not the case for N=6, K=1, which is not N/2 and the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=2, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3 (N/2), answer is No. For N=6, K=4 (which is N/2 + 2), the answer would be Yes or No?\n        # Let's think about N=6, K=4. Bob is at 4. His axis is through 4 and the center. So, the points on his axis are 4 and (2*4 -4) mod 6 = 4. So, only 4. Alice's axis is 0 and 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Which is odd. So, it's impossible to pair them. So, the answer would be No. But according to the previous pattern, since K is not N/2, the answer is Yes. This contradicts the pattern. So, the pattern is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that the condition is more complex. Perhaps the correct condition is that the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # But how to calculate this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of Alice or Bob is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # For Alice's axis, the number of points on it is 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. For Bob's axis, it's 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. But this depends on K.\n        # For example, if N is even, and K is not N/2, then Bob's axis has 2 points. So, the points on Alice's axis are 2, and on Bob's axis are 2. The intersection is 0 if K is not N/2. So, the total number of points on either axis is 2 + 2 - 0 = 4. The total number of points not on either axis is N - 4. For N=6, this is 6-4=2, which is even. So, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3 (N/2), the points on Alice's axis are 2, and on Bob's axis are 1 (since K is N/2, the axis has only 1 point). So, the total number of points on either axis is 2 + 1 - 1 = 2. The number of points not on either axis is 6-2=4, which is even. But the sample input for N=6, K=3 is No. So, this suggests that the condition is not sufficient.\n        # This is getting too complex. Perhaps the solution is to check if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions allow for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # But I'm stuck. Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions allow for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the number of points not on either axis is 4 (even), but the answer is No. So, this condition is not sufficient. What's different in this case?\n        # In this case, Alice's axis includes 0 and 3, and Bob's axis includes 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. But how can the players color these points?\n        # Let's try to simulate. Alice colors 0 (on her axis). Bob can color 3 (on his axis). Now, the set is {0, 3}. Alice's turn. She can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, no move. The game ends. So, the answer is No.\n        # So, the problem is that the initial moves by the players may not allow for all points to be colored, even if the number of points not on the axes is even.\n        # This suggests that the condition is not just about the number of points not on the axes, but also about the initial positions allowing for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # Perhaps the correct condition is that the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can make moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can take turns making moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. This allows for the players to pair them up. But the players must be able to alternate making moves. This depends on the initial positions.\n        # For example, if the initial positions are such that the players can make moves, then it's possible.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions are not on the same axis.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the initial positions are on the same axis (3 is on both Alice's and Bob's axis). So, the answer is No. For N=6, K=2, the initial positions are not on the same axis. So, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, the initial positions are not on the same axis. So, the answer is Yes. For N=200000, K=100000 (N/2), the initial positions are on the same axis. So, the answer is No.\n        # This seems to fit the sample inputs. Let's test this hypothesis.\n        # For N=6, K=3: initial positions are on the same axis (3). So, answer is No.\n        # For N=6, K=2: initial positions are not on the same axis.

Answer is No.\n        # N=4, K=3: initial positions are not on the same axis. Answer is Yes.\n        # So, this hypothesis seems to fit. The condition is that the initial positions are not on the same axis. How to determine this?\n        # The initial positions are on the same axis if and only if K is on Alice's axis. Alice's axis is through 0 and the center. The points on this axis are 0 and N/2 if N is even. So, for K to be on Alice's axis, K must be 0 or N/2. But K is between 1 and N-1, so K can be N/2. So, for K to be on Alice's axis, it must be N/2.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, then the initial positions are on the same axis, and the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2), the answer is No. For N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, it's No.\n        # But what about N=4, K=2 (N/2), the answer is No. For N=4, K=1, the answer is Yes.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, then the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But this seems to fit the sample inputs. Let's check the sample input for N=6, K=1. K is not N/2, so answer is Yes. For N=6, K=2, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, answer is No. For N=200000, K=100000 (N/2), answer is No. So, this seems to fit.\n        # But what about N=4, K=2 (N/2), answer is No. For N=4, K=1, answer is Yes. For N=4, K=3, answer is Yes.\n        # Let's test another case: N=8, K=4 (N/2). Answer is No. For N=8, K=2, answer is Yes.\n        # This seems to fit. So, the condition is: the answer is Yes if and only if K is not equal to N/2.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2) \u2192 No. N=6, K=1 \u2192 Yes. N=6, K=2 \u2192 Yes. N=6, K=3 \u2192 No. This fits.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3, which is N/2. The answer is No. But what if N is even and K is not N/2? The answer is Yes.\n        # So, the solution is to check if K is equal to N/2. If it is, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2), and the players can make moves? Let's think. For example, Alice colors 0. Bob colors 3. Now, the set is {0,3}. Alice's turn. She can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, no move. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the condition is that if K is equal to N/2, then the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But what about N=4, K=1. N/2 is 2.

Answer is No. Correct.\n        # So, this seems to be the correct condition. But why?\n        # Because when K is equal to N/2, Alice and Bob are on the same axis. Alice starts, and she can color a point on the axis. Bob can color the same point (which is already colored). So, he cannot make a move. Hence, the game ends early.\n        # So, the solution is to check if K is equal to N/2. If yes, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3. N is even, K is N/2. Output No.\n        # What about N=4, K=2. Output No.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3. What if Alice colors 3 first? Then Bob can color 3 again? No, it's already colored. So, no move. Hence, answer is No.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, output No. Else, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3. N is even, K is N/2. Output No.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3. Let's think of another scenario. Alice colors 0. Bob colors 3. Then, Alice can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). No move. So, answer is No.\n        # So, this condition seems to be correct.\n        # Now, let's check the sample input for N=6, K=1. K is not N/2. Output is Yes. Correct.\n        # So, the code can be written as follows: For each test case, if N is even and K is equal to N/2, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # Wait, but what about when N is odd? For example, N=5, K=2. N is odd. N/2 is 2.5. So, K cannot be N/2. So, the answer is Yes.\n        # For N=5, K=2. Alice's axis is through 0 and the center (but since N is odd, there is no point opposite to 0. So, the axis for Alice is only 0. Bob's axis is through K=2 and the center. So, the points on Bob's axis are 2 and (2*2 -2) mod 5 = 2. So, only 2. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 3, 4. Which is odd. So, the answer would be No. But according to the condition, since K is not N/2 (N=5, N/2 is 2.5), the answer is Yes. This contradicts.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is not correct.\n        # For N=5, K=2. According to the previous condition, since K is not equal to N/2 (which is not an integer), the answer is Yes. But according to the simulation, it might not be possible.\n        # Let's simulate N=5, K=2. Alice starts at 0, Bob at 2.\n        # Alice's axis is through 0 and the center.

So, the points on his axis are 2 and (2*2 - 2) mod 5 = 2. So, only 2.\n        # So, the points not on either axis are 1, 3, 4. Which is 3 points, odd. So, it's impossible to pair them. Hence, the answer should be No.\n        # But according to the previous condition, since K is not N/2, the answer is Yes. This is a contradiction.\n        # So, the previous condition is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that the condition is more complex. It seems that the condition is not simply whether K is equal to N/2.\n        # At this point, I'm stuck and need to find another approach.\n        # Let's think about the problem from a different angle. The game is a variant of the game where each move colors a point and its symmetric. The players alternate, and the goal is to maximize the number of colored points. The question is whether all points can be colored.\n        # For all points to be colored, the number of points must be even? Or odd?\n        # Let's think: For all points to be colored, the total number of moves must be N. Since each move adds exactly one point, the number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, if N is even, each player makes N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other makes (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions?\n        # The key is whether the players can make all moves. For this, the players must be able to choose points on their axes, and the symmetric of those points must be already colored.\n        # Let's think about the following: For all points to be colored, the initial positions must allow for the players to alternate making moves until all points are colored. This is possible if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the players can alternate making moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. For example, in N=6, K=2, this number is 4 (even). In N=5, K=2, this number is 3 (odd), so it's impossible.\n        # So, the condition is that the number of points not on the axis of either player is even.\n        # Let's calculate this number. The number of points on Alice's axis is 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. For Bob's axis, it's 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. The intersection of these two axes is 1 if K is on Alice's axis, or 0 otherwise.\n        # So, the number of points on either axis is:\n        # For N even:\n        # Alice's axis has 2 points.\n        # Bob's axis has 2 points.\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (i.e., K is 0 or N/2), then the intersection is 1 point. So, total points on either axis is 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.\n        # Otherwise, the intersection is 0, so total is 2 + 2 = 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # Alice's axis has 1 point.\n        # Bob's axis has 1 point.\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (which is only possible if K=0, but K is between 1 and N-1), so it's not possible. So, the intersection is 0. Total is 1 + 1 = 2.\n        # So, the number of points not on either axis is N - (number on either axis).\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K=0 or N/2), then number of points on either axis is 3. So, N - 3.\n        # If K is not on Alice's axis, then number of points on either axis is 4. So, N - 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # Number of points on either axis is 2. So, N - 2.\n        # So, the number of points not on either axis is:\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis: N - 3.\n        # Else: N - 4.\n        # For N odd: N - 2.\n        # For all points to be colored, this number must be even.\n        # Let's check this with the sample inputs.\n        # Sample input 1: N=6 (even), K=2 (not on Alice's axis). N-4 = 6-4=2 (even). So, answer is Yes.\n        # Sample input 2: N=6, K=3 (on Alice's axis). N-3=6-3=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # Sample input 3: N=6, K=1 (not on Alice's axis). N-4=2 (even). Answer is Yes.\n        # Sample input 4: N=200000 (even), K=100000 (on Alice's axis). N-3=200000-3=199997 (odd). Answer is No.\n        # For N=5 (odd), K=2. N-2=5-2=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # This fits with the previous example. So, the condition is that the number of points not on either axis is even.\n        # So, the steps to determine the answer are:\n        # 1. For each test case, calculate the number of points not on either axis.\n        # 2. If this number is even, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n        # Now, how to calculate this number.\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K is 0 or N/2), then the number of points not on either axis is N - 3.\n        # Else, it's N - 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # The number of points not on either axis is N - 2.\n        # So, for N odd, the number is N-2. For this to be even, N-2 must be even \u2192 N must be even. But N is odd, so N-2 is odd. So, for N odd, the number of points not on either axis is odd, so the answer is No.\n        # Wait, this suggests that for N odd, the answer is always No. But this contradicts the earlier example where N=5, K=2. Let's see:\n        # For N=5 (odd), the number of points not on either axis is 5-2=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # But what about N=5, K=2.

Alice's turn. She can color points on her axis (0 is already colored). So, no move. The game ends. So, answer is No. So, the condition is correct.\n        # So, for N odd, the number of points not on either axis is N-2, which is odd. So, the answer is No.\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K=0 or N/2), then the number of points not on either axis is N-3. This must be even.\n        # So, N-3 must be even \u2192 N must be odd. But N is even, so N-3 is odd. So, for N even and K on Alice's axis, the number is odd. So, answer is No.\n        # Else, for N even and K not on Alice's axis, the number is N-4. This must be even \u2192 N-4 must be even \u2192 N must be even. So, for N even and K not on Alice's axis, the number is even. So, answer is Yes.\n        # So, the overall conditions are:\n        # - If N is odd: answer is No.\n        # - If N is even:\n        #   - If K is equal to N/2 or 0 (but K is between 1 and N-1, so K=0 is not possible), then answer is No.\n        #   - Else, answer is Yes.\n        # But wait, for N even, K is between 1 and N-1.

He can color 3 (symmetric of 3 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -3) mod 4 = (2-3) mod 4 = 3. So, he can color 3. Now, all points are colored. So, answer is Yes.\n        # This fits.\n        # So, the code is correct.\n        # Now, the code can be written as follows:\n        # Read T test cases.\n        # For each case:\n        #   if N is odd: print No.\n        #   else:\n        #       if K == N//2: print No.\n        #       else: print Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2).

            "value": "The problem:\n\nGame: Nim-like with moves {1,4}. Alice starts. The player who removes last token wins. This is typical impartial combinatorial game, take-away game. Determine for which starting sizes n up to 2024 does Bob have a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play. Equivalent: Determine all n for which the first player (Alice) is in a losing position (so Bob has a winning strategy). So we need positions that are P-positions (previous player wins) i.e., losing for the player about to move. Since Alice is first, Bob will win exactly when n is a P-position (since Bob as second player will win). So find all positive integers n <= 2024 that are P-positions given moves {1,4}.\n\nLet's analyze the take-away game.\n\nDefine: P-positions: positions where the previous player (the one who just moved) wins, i.e., the next player to move (current) loses with optimal play.\n\nIn take-away games with moves set {1,4}, the P-positions are defined by recursion: a position n is P if none of the positions reachable in one move (i.e., n-1 or n-4 if non-negative) is P (i.e., all reachable positions are N, meaning winning for the player to move). Actually, more formally: n is a P-position if all moves from n lead to N-positions (i.e., winning for the player who has to move next). And n is N if there is at least one move to a P-position.\n\nSo compute P-positions recursively.\n\nWe can attempt to find a pattern.\n\nThe base: 0 tokens: previous player (who removed last token) wins. But our game start positions positive n. But we can use n=0 as P-position by convention, because if there are 0 tokens on your turn, you lose (the previous player removed last). So define n=0 as terminal position where the player to move loses, so it's a P-position. So indeed, n=0 is P (losing for next player). Then we compute upward.\n\nLet move set M = {1,4}.\n\nCompute positions:\n\n- n=0: P\n- n=1: Can remove 1 -> n=0 (P). So there is a move to a P position, so n=1 is N (winning for player).\n- n=2: Moves: remove 1 -> n=1 (N). remove 4 not possible. All reachable positions (only n=1) are N. So cannot force P, so n=2 is P.\n- n=3: Moves: remove 1 -> n=2 (P). So there is a winning move, so n=3 is N.\n- n=4: Moves: remove 1 -> n=3 (N). remove 4 -> n=0 (P). There exists a move to P (n=0). So n=4 is N.\n- n=5: Moves: remove 1 -> n=4 (N), remove 4 -> n=1 (N). All reachable N, so n=5 is P.\n- n=6: Moves: remove 1 -> n=5 (P) -> winning, so n=6 is N.\n- n=7: 1->6(N), 4->3(N). All reachable N, so n=7 is P.\n- n=8: 1->7(P). So n=8 N.\n- n=9: 1->8(N), 4->5(P). There is move to P. So n=9 N. Wait we need to check: 9-1=8 (N). 9-4=5 (P). So there is a move to P, so N.\n- n=10: 1->9(N). 4->6(N). All reachable N, so P.\n- n=11: 1->10(P) -> N.\n- n=12: 1->11(N), 4->8(N). All N, so P.\n- n=13: 1->12(P) -> N.\n- n=14: 1->13(N), 4->10(P). => N (since a move to P).\n- n=15: 1->14(N), 4->11(N). => P.\n- n=16: 1->15(P) => N.\n- n=17: 1->16(N), 4->13(N) => P.\n- n=18: 1->17(P) => N.\n- n=19: 1->18(N), 4->15(P) => N. Actually check: 19-1=18 (N), 19-4=15(P). So there is a winning move to 15 P; thus 19 N.\n- n=20: 1->19(N), 4->16(N) => P.\n- n=21: 1->20(P)=>N.\n- n=22: 1->21(N), 4->18(N) => P.\n- n=23: 1->22(P)=>N.\n- n=24: 1->23(N), 4->20(P) => N.\n- n=25: 1->24(N), 4->21(N) => P.\n- n=26: 1->25(P)=>N.\n- n=27: 1->26(N), 4->23(N)=>P.\n- n=28: 1->27(P)=>N.\n- n=29: 1->28(N), 4->25(P)=>N.\n- n=30: 1->29(N), 4->26(N)=>P.\n- n=31: 1->30(P)=>N.\n- n=32: 1->31(N), 4->28(N)=>P.\n- n=33: 1->32(P)=>N.\n- n=34: 1->33(N), 4->30(P)=>N.\n- n=35: 1->34(N), 4->31(N)=>P.\n- n=36: 1->35(P)=>N.\n- n=37: 1->36(N), 4->33(N)=>P.\n- n=38: 1->37(P)=>N.\n\nSeems pattern emerges: P-positions are maybe those congruent to 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15,... It's not obviously simple modulo something.\n\nBetter to compute and find recurrence or periodicity. Since moves are {1,4}, with maximum removal 4. For impartial take-away games with finite move set, the Sprague-Grundy sequence is eventually periodic with period at most something. For Nim-heap size n with 1,4, the P-positions will eventually be periodic with period equal to least common multiple of something? Actually for subtraction games with subtraction set S, the sequence of P-positions is known to be ultimately periodic with period dividing some function of S, often 2^k?? Actually the subtraction game with S {1,4} maybe has period of length 5? Let's test.\n\nLet's compute more values.\n\nWe have already computed up to n=38 maybe. We can compute further up to maybe > 42 to detect repeating pattern.\n\nLet's list P-positions found up to 38:\n\nIndices n and classification:\n\n0 P\n1 N\n2 P\n3 N\n4 N\n5 P\n6 N\n7 P\n8 N\n9 N\n10 P\n11 N\n12 P\n13 N\n14 N\n15 P\n16 N\n17 P\n18 N\n19 N\n20 P\n21 N\n22 P\n23 N\n24 N\n25 P\n26 N\n27 P\n28 N\n29 N\n30 P\n31 N\n32 P\n33 N\n34 N\n35 P\n36 N\n37 P\n38 N\n39... compute.\n\nNow we can derive pattern: The sequence of P-positions seems to follow a rule: After each group, there's a pattern of length maybe 5? Let's check consecutive P positions differences:\n\nDifferences between consecutive P positions: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2, 15-12=3, 17-15=2, 20-17=3, 22-20=2, 25-22=3, 27-25=2, 30-27=3, 32-30=2, 35-32=3, 37-35=2, 40-37=3? Wait 40? Let's compute n=39 and n=40 to confirm.\n\nLet's compute n=39:\n\nn=39: 1->38(N), 4->35(P) => N (move to P). So 39 N.\n\nn=40: 1->39(N), 4->36(N) => P. So 40 P. So difference 40-37=3. Good.\n\nNow differences continue: pattern 2,3,2,3,... repeating? Let's continue further.\n\nn=41: 1->40(P) => N.\n\nn=42: 1->41(N), 4->38(N) => P. So 42 P? Wait check: 42-1=41 (N), 42-4=38 (N). So all reachable are N -> P indeed. So 42 P. The difference 42-40=2. pattern 2,3,2,3,... continues.\n\nn=43: 1->42(P) -> N\n\nn=44: 1->43(N), 4->40(P) -> N. So 44 N.\n\nn=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N) -> P? Wait 45-1=44 (N), 45-4=41 (N). So all reachable N, thus 45 P. Diff 45-42=3.\n\nn=46: 1->45(P) -> N.\n\nn=47: 1->46(N), 4->43(N) -> P? 47-4=43 (N). So 47 reachable N; 47-1=46 (N). All reachable N -> 47 P. Diff 47-45=2.\n\nn=48: 1->47(P) -> N.\n\nn=49: 1->48(N), 4->45(P) -> N. So 49 N.\n\nn=50: 1->49(N), 4->46(N) -> P. Diff 50-47=3? Wait 50-47=3 actually 50-47=3. Wait 47 is P. We said 47 P. 50-47=3. But 50 P indeed. So pattern holds.\n\nn=51: 1->50(P) => N.\n\nn=52: 1->51(N), 4->48(N) -> P (diff 52-50=2).\n\nn=53: 1->52(P) => N.\n\nn=54: 1->53(N), 4->50(P) => N. So 54 N.\n\nn=55: 1->54(N), 4->51(N) -> P. Diff 55-52=3.\n\nn=56: 1->55(P) -> N.\n\nn=57: 1->56(N), 4->53(N) -> P? Wait 57-4=53 (N). So 57 P. Diff 57-55=2.\n\nn=58: 1->57(P) -> N.\n\nn=59: 1->58(N), 4->55(P) => N. So 59 N.\n\nn=60: 1->59(N), 4->56(N) => P. Diff 60-57=3.\n\nWe see a repeating pattern: P positions come in groups separated by pattern [2,3] repeated? Let's confirm from start:\n\nStarting from n=0 P.\n\nP positions list for first few:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,32,35,37,40,42,45,47,50,52,55,57,60,...\n\nLet's check the difference pattern:\n\n0->2: 2\n2->5: 3\n5->7: 2\n7->10:3\n10->12:2\n12->15:3\n15->17:2\n17->20:3\n20->22:2\n22->25:3\n25->27:2\n27->30:3\n30->32:2\n32->35:3\n35->37:2\n37->40:3\n40->42:2\n42->45:3\n45->47:2\n47->50:3\n50->52:2\n52->55:3\n55->57:2\n57->60:3\n\nSo indeed pattern [2,3] repeated, starting from 0. So P-positions for the subtraction set {1,4} follow the pattern 0,2,5,7,10,... with differences alternating 2,3,...\n\nThus P positions are numbers that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Let's think: sequence maybe all numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let's test a few numbers: 0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,... Are all of those P? Let's check 5 is P (yes). 10 P, 15 P, 20 P, etc. 30 P, 35 P, 40 P, 45 P. Check 25 P? yes. 50 P. So all numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 appear to be P.\n\nNow numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57,... All are P as per list.\n\nNumbers congruent to 1 mod5: 1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56,... Not P? Let's check: 1 N, 6 N, 11 N, 16 N, 21 N, 26 N, 31 N, 36 N, 41 N, 46 N, 51 N, 56 N. So indeed 1 mod 5 are N.\n\nNumbers congruent to 3 mod5: 3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58,... N? Let's check: 3 N, 8 N? Wait 8 is N. 13 N? 13 N. 18 N. 23 N. 28 N. 33 N. 38 N. 43 N. 48 N. 53 N. 58 N. Are these all N? Check 48: above we had 48 N? Actually we earlier found 48: n=48 we determined 48? Wait we had 48? Let's check 48 earlier: n=48 (from sequence above) I think 48 N. I recall 48 was \"N\"? Let's double-check.\n\nAt n=48: Moves: 48-1=47 (P). Wait 47 P. So 48 has a move to a P- position, thus 48 is N. Yes, 48 N. 53: n=53 we found a move? Let's compute: 53-1=52 (P) so 53 N. 58: 58-1=57(P) -> 58 N. So yes 3 mod5 are N.\n\nNumbers congruent to 4 mod5: 4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49,54,59,... Should be N? Let's check: 4 N? Wait earlier we had 4 N. 9 N? We found 9 N. 14 N? We found 14 N. 19 N? We found 19 N. 24 N? We found 24?? Let's check: 24 we found earlier as N? Wait above we had 24 N? I recall 24 N? Let's check: 24: 1->23(N) 4->20(P) so 24 N. So 24 N indeed. 29 N? We had 29 N. 34 N? 34 N. 39 N? 39 N. 44 N? Wait earlier we had 44 N. 49 N? 49 N. 54 N? 54 N. 59 N? 59 N. So 4 mod5 numbers also N.\n\nThus P positions are exactly numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. That matches pattern: differences 2,3 repeating produce all numbers equivalently 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nBut is this pattern fully correct? Let's double-check initial values: 0 P, 2 P, 5 P, 7 P, 10 P, 12 P, etc. They are indeed numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5? Let's compute modulo 5:\n\n0 %5 =0\n2%5=2\n5%5=0\n7%5=2\n10%5=0\n12%5=2\n15%5=0\n17%5=2\n20%5=0\n22%5=2\n25%5=0\n27%5=2\n30%5=0\n32%5=2\n35%5=0\n37%5=2\n40%5=0\n42%5=2\n45%5=0\n47%5=2\n50%5=0\n52%5=2\n55%5=0\n57%5=2\n60%5=0\n62%5=2? Wait 62 we didn't compute but pattern would hold. Should be P.\n\nThus pattern holds. We can prove via recursion: Because positions modulo 5 determine outcome in subtraction games with moves {1,4}.\n\nGeneral reasoning: The game of taking 1 or 4 tokens is a subtraction game with subtraction set S = {1,4}. The P-positions are known to have the property that they are periodic with period 5, with 0 and 2 as P-positions. Indeed, the Grundy function values repeat with period 5. Let's confirm by computing Grundy numbers.\n\nCompute Grundy numbers g(n) = mex{g(n-1), g(n-4)} for n>=1.\n\nInitialize g(0)=0.\n\nCompute:\n\nn=0: g(0)=0.\n\nn=1: g(1) = mex{ g(0)=0 } = 1. (since only option is remove 1 leads to g0=0). So g1=1.\n\nn=2: g(2) = mex{ g(1)=1 } = 0. So g2=0.\n\nn=3: g(3) = mex{ g(2)=0 } = 1. So g3=1.\n\nn=4: g(4)= mex{ g(3)=1, g(0)=0 } -> mex{0,1} = 2. So g4=2.\n\nn=5: g(5)= mex{ g(4)=2, g(1)=1 } -> mex{1,2} = 0. So g5=0.\n\nn=6: g6= mex{ g5=0, g2=0 } -> mex{0} = 1. g6=1.\n\nn=7: g7= mex{ g6=1, g3=1 } -> mex{1} = 0. g7=0.\n\nn=8: g8= mex{ g7=0, g4=2 } -> mex{0,2}=1? Wait mex of {0,2} is 1. So g8=1.\n\nn=9: g9 = mex{ g8=1, g5=0 } -> mex{0,1} = 2. g9=2.\n\nn=10: g10 = mex{ g9=2, g6=1 } -> mex{1,2} = 0. g10=0.\n\nObserving pattern: g(n) cycles with period 5: values [0,1,0,1,2]?\n\nLet's compute sequence of Grundy numbers for n=0..10:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\ng: 0 1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 2 0\n\nYes, repeating 0,1,0,1,2. That is period 5. The P-positions are those with zero Grundy number. g(n) = 0 for n = 0,2,5,7,10,12,... That's exactly n mod5 in {0,2}? Wait check n mod5:\n\nn=0:0->0\nn5: 5%5=0->0\nn=10%5=0->0\nn=2%5=2->0\nn=7%5=2->0\nn=12%5=2->0\n\nYes.\n\nThus answer: Count number of positive integers n <= 2024 such that n mod5 in {0,2}. Excluding 0 because n positive. So we count numbers <=2024 which are 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWe need to count positive n. Let's find floor count:\n\n- Compute number of integers <=2024 that are 0 mod5: floor(2024/5) = ?\n\n2024 /5 = 404.8? Actually 5*404=2020. So up to 2024 there are 404 whole multiples. So numbers 5,10,...,2020 are 404 numbers. But 0 is also a multiple, but n positive, and 2024 may not be multiple of 5. We'll keep that.\n\nBut we also count numbers that are 2 mod5: numbers of form 5k+2 <=2024. Max k such that 5k+2 <=2024: k <= (2024-2)/5 = 2022/5 = 404.4 -> floor 404. So k=0 to 404 inclusive? Wait for positive n we may consider k starting from 0: 5*0+2=2; yes. So there are 405 such numbers? Let's count: from k=0 to 404 inclusive inclusive count = 404-0+1 = 405. Is that correct? Let's check: 5k+2 \u2264 2024. k max = floor((2024-2)/5) = floor(2022/5) = floor(404.4) = 404. So k=0..404 inclusive results in 405 numbers. Let's list some: 2,7,12,...,5*404+2=2020+2=2022? Wait 5*404 = 2020; +2 = 2022. So 2022 indeed <=2024. Good.\n\nWe also need to include multiples of 5 <=2024: 5* k <=2024 => k <=floor(2024/5)=404. So k=1 to 404 inclusive gives 404 numbers. But also k=0 gives 0, but 0 is not positive, so exclude. So 404 numbers.\n\nTotal: 404 + 405 = 809? Wait 404+405=809. Let's check: 404+405 = 809 indeed.\n\nThus the number of positive integers n <= 2024 such that n mod5 in {0,2} is 809.\n\nBut we need to double-check that the pattern holds for all n up to 2024. But we derived from recurrence and pattern period 5, so yes.\n\nHowever we should verify that we have not omitted any n like 2024? 2024 mod5 = 2024-2020=4. So 2024 is not in {0,2} mod5, so Bob does not have winning strategy for 2024. So 809 counts numbers up to 2023 maybe? But we included up to 2024 inclusive. Good.\n\nNow ensure calculation: For 2024 inclusive, number of numbers <=2024 with mod 5=0: 404 (5,10,...,2020). Numbers with mod5=2: 405 (2,7,...,2022). Total 809. Good.\n\nDouble-check counts:\n\nNumber of multiples of 5 up to N: floor(N/5). For N=2024 -> floor(2024/5) = 404. And 0 is counted if we included k=0. But we only counted positive n, and multiples start at 5. So 404 numbers.\n\nNow number of numbers \u22612 (mod 5) <= N: floor((N-2)/5)+1? Actually formula: For any N\u22652, the number of numbers \u2261 2 mod5 up to N is floor((N-2)/5)+1. But we must ensure not to double count 2? No.\n\nLet's compute: floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405. Yes.\n\nAdd 404 yields 809.\n\nAlternatively we can unify as floor(N/5)+floor((N+3)/5)?? Wait to double-check formula: Number of numbers \u22612 mod5 \u2264N is floor((N-2)/5)+1 if N\u22652 else maybe 0. For N\u22652, fine.\n\nLet's compute maybe using a different method: The numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5 can be enumerated as 5k or 5k+2. For 0: k from 1 to floor(N/5). For 2: k from 0 to floor((N-2)/5). So total floor(N/5)+floor((N-2)/5)+1. But careful with overlapping? No.\n\nFor N=2024: floor(N/5)=404; floor((N-2)/5)=floor(2022/5)=404. So total 404+404+1=809. Wait we earlier had 404 + 405? 405 is floor((N-2)/5)+1=404+1=405. So 404 + 405 = 809. In the sum formula we had 404+404+1=809. Good.\n\nNow we want positive integers n (i.e., n\u22651). We considered n=0 (which is P but not allowed). So answer 809.\n\nBut we should ensure that the initial reasoning that Bob's winning strategy exists if and only if n is a P-position is correct. In impartial combinatorial games with perfect play, the player whose turn arrives at a P-position is guaranteed to lose if both play optimally. So if Alice starts at a P-position, Alice loses, thus Bob wins. So yes Bob has winning strategy if n is P. So we need count of P up to 2024.\n\nThus answer 809.\n\nBut we should consider \"strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\" This is same as Bob being the second player. In impartial games with perfect play, if starting position is a P-position, then the first player loses assuming optimal play by second player. But careful: Some games are not necessarily symmetric? But this is subtraction game; it's impartial and deterministic; no chance.\n\nThus our answer stands.\n\nWe should provide reasoning step-by-step as requested.\n\nLet's produce final answer: $\\boxed{809}$.\n\nBut let's double-check to ensure we didn't miscount. Let's double-check with small N to confirm.\n\nCompute for N=10: Count numbers <=10 with mod 5 in {0,2}:\n\n- 0? Not positive. 5 (0 mod5) qualifies. 2 (2 mod5) qualifies. So numbers: 2,5. Also 7? Wait <=10 includes 7 (2 mod5), so 3 numbers 2,5,7? But 7 <=10 yes. So 3 numbers. Wait but also 0? No. So for N=10 we count 3. Let's compute using formula: floor(10/5)=2 (multiples of 5) -> 5 and 10? Wait 10 is multiple of 5 but >10? 10 is equal. So 5 and 10. 10 qualifies. So 2 multiples of 5: 5,10. For 2 mod5: numbers 2,7? 12 >10. So 2 numbers. Total 4. But earlier I counted 3. Let's recalc: numbers <=10 positive: 1 to 10 inclusive. Let's list which are P positions: According to our sequence, P positions <=10: 2,5,7,10. Wait 10 is P. Yes. So there are 4 numbers. Let's verify our earlier method: floor(10/5)=2 (multiples 5,10). floor((10-2)/5)+1 = floor(8/5)+1 = 1+1=2 (numbers 2,7). That's 2. Total 2+2 = 4. Yes. So 4 matches.\n\nSo count formula works.\n\nNow for N=2024:\n\n- Multiples: numbers 5,10,...,2020 -> 404\n- plus 2 mod5 numbers: 2,7,...,2022 -> 405\n\nTotal 809.\n\nDouble-check with an alternative: Let's find the sequence of P numbers up to 2024: 2,5,7,... 2022 maybe? 2024? 2024 is 4 mod5. So last P <=2024 is 2022. Let's calculate number: starting at 2, difference pattern: sequence defined by alternating 3 and 2 increments starting from 2? Actually starting from 2 up to 2022 inclusive. Let's compute number of terms: The sequence is 2,5,7,10,...,2022.\n\nWe can compute number of terms using formula: The nth P-positions form arithmetic progression? But it's not a simple arithmetic progression, but pattern repeating 5-length. Actually the positions n congruent to 0 or 2 mod5 are exactly those of the form 5k+2 or 5k. So count equals count of k such that 5k<=2024 and k>=1 + count of k such that 5k+2 <=2024 and k>=0. This yields 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nDouble-check: The largest multiple of 5 <=2024 is 2020. 2020 = 5*404. So 404 multiples. Largest number \u2261 2 mod5 <=2024 is 2022 = 5*404+2. That's k=404. So 405 terms. So total 809.\n\nThus answer is 809.\n\nNow we should explain the reasoning step-by-step. Also verify that for n=1 Bob doesn't have a winning strategy. Our calculations confirm that n=1 is N. So that's fine.\n\nLet's now present final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{809}$\n\nBut maybe we need to provide reasoning: \"For this subtraction game with allowed moves 1 and 4, the winning positions for second player are all n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5). Because we can compute Grundy numbers or by induction on n that P-positions are those values. So we count how many positive integers \u2264 2024 satisfy n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5). That count is 404+405=809.\"\n\nAlso we can note that P-positions mod5 are 0 and 2.\n\nWe need to ensure we consider that Bob can guarantee to win if Alice's position is P. Because Bob is second player. So we indeed count such n.\n\nHence final answer: 809.\n\nNow let's craft final answer.\n\nWe can mention Grundy numbers: g(n) = mex(g(n-1), g(n-4)). Then show pattern repeated with period 5: g(n) = [0,1,0,1,2] repeating. So g(n)=0 iff n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5 => Bob wins. So count. Provide final answer.\n\nLet's produce final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nThat's it."

            "value": "The problem:\n\nGame: Nim-like with moves {1,4}. Alice starts. The player who removes last token wins. This is typical impartial combinatorial game, take-away game. Determine for which starting sizes n up to 2024 does Bob have a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play. Equivalent: Determine all n for which the first player (Alice) is in a losing position (so Bob has a winning strategy). So we need positions that are P-positions (previous player wins) i.e., losing for the player about to move. Since Alice is first, Bob will win exactly when n is a P-position (since Bob as second player will win). So find all positive integers n <= 2024 that are P-positions given moves {1,4}.\n\nLet's analyze the take-away game.\n\nDefine: P-positions: positions where the previous player (the one who just moved) wins, i.e., the next player to move (current) loses with optimal play.\n\nIn take-away games with moves set {1,4}, the P-positions are defined by recursion: a position n is P if none of the positions reachable in one move (i.e., n-1 or n-4 if non-negative) is P (i.e., all reachable positions are N, meaning winning for the player to move). Actually, more formally: n is a P-position if all moves from n lead to N-positions (i.e., winning for the player who has to move next). And n is N if there is at least one move to a P-position.\n\nSo compute P-positions recursively.\n\nWe can attempt to find a pattern.\n\nThe base: 0 tokens: previous player (who removed last token) wins. But our game start positions positive n. But we can use n=0 as P-position by convention, because if there are 0 tokens on your turn, you lose (the previous player removed last). So define n=0 as terminal position where the player to move loses, so it's a P-position. So indeed, n=0 is P (losing for next player). Then we compute upward.\n\nLet move set M = {1,4}.\n\nCompute positions:\n\n- n=0: P\n- n=1: Can remove 1 -> n=0 (P). So there is a move to a P position, so n=1 is N (winning for player).\n- n=2: Moves: remove 1 -> n=1 (N). remove 4 not possible. All reachable positions (only n=1) are N. So cannot force P, so n=2 is P.\n- n=3: Moves: remove 1 -> n=2 (P). So there is a winning move, so n=3 is N.\n- n=4: Moves: remove 1 -> n=3 (N). remove 4 -> n=0 (P). There exists a move to P (n=0). So n=4 is N.\n- n=5: Moves: remove 1 -> n=4 (N), remove 4 -> n=1 (N). All reachable N, so n=5 is P.\n- n=6: Moves: remove 1 -> n=5 (P) -> winning, so n=6 is N.\n- n=7: 1->6(N), 4->3(N). All reachable N, so n=7 is P.\n- n=8: 1->7(P). So n=8 N.\n- n=9: 1->8(N), 4->5(P). There is move to P. So n=9 N. Wait we need to check: 9-1=8 (N). 9-4=5 (P). So there is a move to P, so N.\n- n=10: 1->9(N). 4->6(N). All reachable N, so P.\n- n=11: 1->10(P) -> N.\n- n=12: 1->11(N), 4->8(N). All N, so P.\n- n=13: 1->12(P) -> N.\n- n=14: 1->13(N), 4->10(P). => N (since a move to P).\n- n=15: 1->14(N), 4->11(N). => P.\n- n=16: 1->15(P) => N.\n- n=17: 1->16(N), 4->13(N) => P.\n- n=18: 1->17(P) => N.\n- n=19: 1->18(N), 4->15(P) => N. Actually check: 19-1=18 (N), 19-4=15(P). So there is a winning move to 15 P; thus 19 N.\n- n=20: 1->19(N), 4->16(N) => P.\n- n=21: 1->20(P)=>N.\n- n=22: 1->21(N), 4->18(N) => P.\n- n=23: 1->22(P)=>N.\n- n=24: 1->23(N), 4->20(P) => N.\n- n=25: 1->24(N), 4->21(N) => P.\n- n=26: 1->25(P)=>N.\n- n=27: 1->26(N), 4->23(N)=>P.\n- n=28: 1->27(P)=>N.\n- n=29: 1->28(N), 4->25(P)=>N.\n- n=30: 1->29(N), 4->26(N)=>P.\n- n=31: 1->30(P)=>N.\n- n=32: 1->31(N), 4->28(N)=>P.\n- n=33: 1->32(P)=>N.\n- n=34: 1->33(N), 4->30(P)=>N.\n- n=35: 1->34(N), 4->31(N)=>P.\n- n=36: 1->35(P)=>N.\n- n=37: 1->36(N), 4->33(N)=>P.\n- n=38: 1->37(P)=>N.\n\nSeems pattern emerges: P-positions are maybe those congruent to 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15,... It's not obviously simple modulo something.\n\nBetter to compute and find recurrence or periodicity. Since moves are {1,4}, with maximum removal 4. For impartial take-away games with finite move set, the Sprague-Grundy sequence is eventually periodic with period at most something. For Nim-heap size n with 1,4, the P-positions will eventually be periodic with period equal to least common multiple of something? Actually for subtraction games with subtraction set S, the sequence of P-positions is known to be ultimately periodic with period dividing some function of S, often 2^k?? Actually the subtraction game with S {1,4} maybe has period of length 5? Let's test.\n\nLet's compute more values.\n\nWe have already computed up to n=38 maybe. We can compute further up to maybe > 42 to detect repeating pattern.\n\nLet's list P-positions found up to 38:\n\nIndices n and classification:\n\n0 P\n1 N\n2 P\n3 N\n4 N\n5 P\n6 N\n7 P\n8 N\n9 N\n10 P\n11 N\n12 P\n13 N\n14 N\n15 P\n16 N\n17 P\n18 N\n19 N\n20 P\n21 N\n22 P\n23 N\n24 N\n25 P\n26 N\n27 P\n28 N\n29 N\n30 P\n31 N\n32 P\n33 N\n34 N\n35 P\n36 N\n37 P\n38 N\n39... compute.\n\nNow we can derive pattern: The sequence of P-positions seems to follow a rule: After each group, there's a pattern of length maybe 5? Let's check consecutive P positions differences:\n\nDifferences between consecutive P positions: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2, 15-12=3, 17-15=2, 20-17=3, 22-20=2, 25-22=3, 27-25=2, 30-27=3, 32-30=2, 35-32=3, 37-35=2, 40-37=3? Wait 40? Let's compute n=39 and n=40 to confirm.\n\nLet's compute n=39:\n\nn=39: 1->38(N), 4->35(P) => N (move to P). So 39 N.\n\nn=40: 1->39(N), 4->36(N) => P. So 40 P. So difference 40-37=3. Good.\n\nNow differences continue: pattern 2,3,2,3,... repeating? Let's continue further.\n\nn=41: 1->40(P) => N.\n\nn=42: 1->41(N), 4->38(N) => P. So 42 P? Wait check: 42-1=41 (N), 42-4=38 (N). So all reachable are N -> P indeed. So 42 P. The difference 42-40=2. pattern 2,3,2,3,... continues.\n\nn=43: 1->42(P) -> N\n\nn=44: 1->43(N), 4->40(P) -> N. So 44 N.\n\nn=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N) -> P?\n\nI received a request from the user to provide an answer right now.

Alice goes first. They ask: count number of positive integers n <= 2024 for which Bob has a strategy that guarantees winning regardless of Alice's play. This means Bob as second player wins => initial n must be a P-position (losing for player about to move). So we need to find all positive integers n <= 2024 such that the first player loses with optimal play.\n\nWe can solve by computing P-positions: starting from n=0 as P. Then for each n compute if there is a move to a P, if yes then n is N else P. We compute until we see a pattern.\n\nI have to produce a step-by-step explanation. Provide a final answer in boxed form.\n\nWe need to find all n such that Bob can win. That means n is P-position for the first player.\n\nWe compute the pattern. For subtraction game with moves {1,4}, the Nim-type positions repeat periodically. We can compute the initial P-positions.\n\nBut is there a pattern we can derive? The earlier reasoning gave pattern \"P positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\"\n\nIt appears that P-positions have difference pattern: 2,3,2,3,... i.e., from 0 to 2 diff 2; 2 to 5 diff 3; 5 to 7 diff 2; 7 to 10 diff 3, etc. So P-positions are those with n mod 3 = 2? Wait: Let's check:\n\nList of P positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,...\n\nLet's compute n mod 3: 0 mod 3 = 0, 2 mod 3 = 2, 5 mod 3 = 2, 7 mod 3 = 1, 10 mod 3 = 1, 12 mod 3 = 0, 15 mod 3 = 0, 17 mod 3 = 2, 20 mod 3 = 2, 22 mod 3 = 1, 25 mod 3 = 1, 27 mod 3 = 0, 30 mod 3 = 0... This is not constant. So maybe P positions are those that are not 1 mod 4? Wait let's check: n=2 mod 3 includes 2,5,8,11,... doesn't match? 8 is not P: 8 is N. So it's not simple mod 3.\n\nBut we might have mis-calc: let's recompute carefully again.\n\nWait earlier we concluded that P positions follow pattern: differences 2,3 repeating. That would produce positions: Starting from 0: 0; +2 =>2; +3=>5; +2=>7; +3=>10; +2=>12; +3=>15; +2=>17; +3=>20; +2=>22; +3=>25; +2=>27; +3=>30; +2=>32; +3=>35; +2=>37; +3=>40; +2=>42; +3=>45; +2=>47; +3=>50, etc.\n\nLet's check whether 8 would be a P-position according to this rule: 8 is not in that sequence because it's 7 then 10 next. So 8 is N indeed. So the sequence 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nThus P positions mod something might be 0,2,2,1,1,0,0,2,... It's a repeating cycle of mod 6? Let's compute mod 5 maybe? 0 mod5=0; 2=2; 5=0; 7=2; 10=0; 12=2; 15=0; 17=2; 20=0; 22=2;... Actually pattern of mod5: 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,... So pattern: 0 or 2 mod 5. Wait but 0 mod5 at n=0,5,10,15,20,25,30, ... Yes. 2 mod5 at n=2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,... That matches indeed. So P-positions are exactly numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Let's check with 15: 15 mod5=0. 20 mod5=0. 25 mod5=0. 30 mod5=0. 35 mod5=0. Yes. 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,... yes. In our pattern, 0 is P as well because it's the endpoint. But we start at n positive. So we count positive n <=2024 that are 0 mod5 or 2 mod5? But 0 mod5 includes 5,10,15,... But 0 itself is not positive. But 5 is indeed P, 10 is P, etc. And 2 mod5 includes 2,7,12,17,... Are those indeed all P positions? Let's verify some: n=2 is P (correct). 7 is P. 12 is P. 17 is P. 22 is P. 27 is P. 32 is P. 37 is P. So indeed that holds. So the pattern emerges: P positions are numbers that are 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nWait check n=0: 0 mod5 => P. Good. So indeed the set is {n | n \u22610 or 2 (mod 5)}.\n\nBut earlier we also had representation as {n = 3q+2 or n=...}. That pattern seemed wrong now. Let's test: 3q+2 set: 2,5,8,11,14... but that includes 5 and 2, but 8 is not a P position. So that representation is wrong. The correct pattern for {0 or 2 mod5} emerges from the differences 2,3 repeating. Wait does that produce 0,2,5,... Yes. So mod5 representation is correct: sequence: 0,2,5,7,10,12,... Yes. So correct representation: n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod5). Let's verify for n=25: 25 mod5 =0 => P; yes. n=30 mod5=0; yes. n=32 mod5=2; yes. n=45 mod5=0; but 45 according to pattern earlier: we didn't compute 45 but we would anticipate 45 is P because 45 mod5=0. Let's check with manual: n=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N), so all N => P. Yes.\n\nSo we adopt that representation: P positions are n such that n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod5).\n\nHence positive n <=2024 that are P positions are numbers n with n \u2261 0, 2 (mod 5). Count them.\n\nWe need to count positive n <= 2024 that satisfy n \u22610 mod5 or n \u22612 mod5. Let's compute using arithmetic sequences:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 between 1 and 2024: smallest 5, largest floor(2024/5)*5 = (2024/5 = 404.8 => floor 404)*5 = 2020. So there are floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: first 2, last? Compute largest \u22642024: largest k such that \\(5k+2 \\le 2024\\). Solve k <= (2022)/5 = 404.4 => floor 404. So largest is 5*404+2=2020+2=2022. So also 404 numbers.\n\nBut careful: we include n\u22651. 0 is not counted because they said positive integers only, so 0 is not included. But our counts start at 5 for \u22610 mod5 and 2 for \u22612 mod5. So we have 404 numbers for each class because 0 excluded but 0 is not in that range. But we need to confirm that 2020 (5*404) is indeed within \u22642024. Yes.\n\nSo total positive integers <=2024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5: 404+404 = 808.\n\nWait we also counted n=2020 (5*404) which is indeed <=2024, yes. So 808 P-positions.\n\nHowever earlier I had 675 from misanalysis earlier. That was erroneous. Which one is correct? Let's double-check.\n\nHold on. The earlier pattern we computed earlier and wrote 675 was derived from n\u22612 mod3 incorrectly. That seems wrong now, because we realized the pattern is mod5. So we must double-check the entire reasoning.\n\nWe need to confirm that indeed for this game the set of P-positions is exactly those where n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet's test more positions for sanity:\n\nWe have computed manually up to n=45 (approx). Let's produce a table of n and classification.\n\nI earlier produced table up to 45.\n\nLet's compute further to confirm beyond 45, e.g., 50,53,55, etc.\n\nCompute systematically using recurrence:\n\nWe can compute iterative classification:\n\nWe already have up to n=45:\n\nn  P? \n0 P\n1 N\n2 P\n3 N\n4 N\n5 P\n6 N\n7 P\n8 N\n9 N\n10 P\n11 N\n12 P\n13 N\n14 N\n15 P\n16 N\n17 P\n18 N\n19 N\n20 P\n21 N\n22 P\n23 N\n24 N\n25 P\n26 N\n27 P\n28 N\n29 N\n30 P\n31 N\n32 P\n33 N\n34 N\n35 P\n36 N\n37 P\n38 N\n39 N\n40 P\n41 N\n42 P\n43 N\n44 N\n45 P\n46 N\n47 P? Let's compute.\n\nWait we didn't compute 46 and 47 earlier, let's do from 45 onwards:\n\nn=44: 44-1=43 (N), 44-4=40 (P) => 44 N?\n\nLet's double-check 44: 44-1=43 (N?). Wait we said 43 is N. Let's check 43: n=43: 1->42 (P) => 43 N. So 44: 44-1=43 (N). 44-4=40 (P). So 44 has a move to P (40). So 44 is N.\n\nNow n=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N). So 45 P. That matches.\n\nNow n=46: 1->45 (P) => 46 N. So 46 N.\n\nn=47: 1->46 (N), 4->43 (N). Both N, so 47 P. Yes 47 fits pattern: 47 mod5 =2. So P.\n\nn=48: 1->47(P) -> N. So 48 N.\nn=49: 1->48(N), 4->45(P). So 49 N because has move to P. But 49 mod5 =4. So N.\n\nn=50: 1->49(N), 4->46(N). So 50 P. 50 mod5 =0. Yes.\n\nn=51: 1->50(P) -> N. So 51 N (51 mod5=1).\nn=52: 1->51(N), 4->48(N). So 52 P? Wait 52 mod5=2. But we need to check if 52 is indeed P: moves from 52: remove 1 ->51 (N). Remove 4 ->48 (N). So no P reachable, so 52 P. Yes.\n\nSo pattern holds: 52 is P and 52 mod5=2.\n\nContinue to confirm more:\n\nn=53: 1->52(P) -> N. So N. 53 mod5=3\nn=54: 1->53(N), 4->50(P). So N. 54 mod5=4\nn=55: 1->54(N), 4->51(N). So P. 55 mod5=0.\n\nWe can see pattern continues.\n\nHence indeed P positions: numbers \u22610 mod5 or \u22612 mod5.\n\nNow we need to find number of positive integers <=2024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nNow 2024/5=404.8, so floor floor is 404.\n\nList for mod5=0: 5,10,...,2020. There are 404 numbers.\n\nList for mod5=2: 2,7,12,...,2022? Wait 2022=5*404+2 = 2022. That's <=2024. So there are 404 numbers again. So sum = 808.\n\nDouble-check: Does 0 mod5 also include 0? We should not include zero because we only count positive. Yes.\n\nHence answer: total 808.\n\nThus Bob has a winning strategy for 808 values of n <=2024.\n\nBut earlier in the earlier analysis we had 675, which is wrong. We need to rectify.\n\nHowever earlier we earlier enumerated differences as 2,3 repeating which leads to mod5 classification: numbers that start at 0 then +2 ->2, +3 ->5, +2->7,... Indeed that yields numbers 0,2,5,7,10,12... That's exactly numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5. Because difference is 2,3 repeating gives pattern: 0,2,5,7,10,12,... which is indeed such.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is 808.\n\nBut the reasoning earlier mis-copied that P positions were 0 or 2 mod3. Let's rectify.\n\nWe have to produce the final solution with reasoning, step-by-step.\n\nWe should mention that the game is impartial with subtractions {1,4} which is a subtraction game. It's known that the P-positions repeat periodically with period 5 for this set.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute Grundy numbers or compute the pattern.\n\nLet us produce final answer: 808.\n\nWe also might include explanation of classification via induction or algorithm:\n\nDefine the positions:\n\nLet \\(S = \\{1,4\\}\\). Define \\(a_n\\) to be Nim-value (SG) or classification. But simpler to classify by N vs P.\n\nWe can define the recurrence: A position \\(n\\) is P if and only if \\(n-1\\) and \\(n-4\\) (if positive) are N. Because only two moves.\n\nWe can check initial states and compute pattern until cycle arises.\n\nWe might also use the concept of Sprague-Grundy function g(n) = mex{g(n-1), g(n-4)}. Starting g(0)=0 (since 0 is terminal). Then we calculate successive g(n) until pattern emerges (g(n) repeats modulo 5). But we only need classification for P vs N: g(n)=0 indicates P. So we compute g(n) modulo?\n\nCompute g:\n\ng(0)=0\ng(1)=mex{g(0)}=mex{0}=1\ng(2)=mex{g(1)}=mex{1}=0 -> P\ng(3)=mex{g(2)}=mex{0}=1\ng(4)=mex{g(3),g(0)}=mex{1,0}=2? Wait, mex of {1,0} is 2. So g(4) = 2 > 0 => N.\ng(5)=mex{g(4),g(1)}=mex{2,1}=0? Since 0 not present, mex=0. So P.\ng(6)=mex{g(5)}=mex{0}=1. So N.\ng(7)=mex{g(6)}=mex{1}=0 => P\ng(8)=mex{g(7)}=mex{0}=1 => N\ng(9)=mex{g(8),g(5)}=mex{1,0}=2 => N\ng(10)=mex{g(9),g(6)}=mex{2,1}=0 => P\ng(11)=mex{g(10)}=mex{0}=1 => N\ng(12)=mex{g(11)}=mex{1}=0 => P\ng(13)=mex{g(12)}=mex{0}=1 => N\ng(14)=mex {g(13),g(10)}=mex{1,0}=2 => N\ng(15)=mex{g(14),g(11)}=mex{2,1}=0 => P\n...\nWe see pattern repeating after every 5: 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,... Actually g(n) pattern of period 5: 0,1,0,1,2 repeating? Let's check: sequence g: 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,... The pattern: indices 0 mod 5 => 0; 1 mod 5 => 1; 2 mod 5 => 0; 3 mod 5 => 1; 4 mod 5 => 2.\n\nThus g(n)=0 at n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Yes. So P-positions are exactly n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Good. So that's a simpler argument.\n\nHence answer 808.\n\nLet's produce final answer with steps: compute Grundy numbers or classification, find period 5, count numbers \u22642024 of that congruence.\n\nNow I will produce final answer.\n\nBut note: The problem didn't specify that tokens can be removed at most 4 tokens. Actually player may remove either 1 token or 4 tokens at a turn. So the move set is {1,4}. Yes.\n\nThus final result: 808.\n\nWe can present in a nice format:\n\n- Compute Grundy function g(0)=0\n- For n\u22651: g(n)=mex{ g(n-1), g(n-4) } with convention g(k)=0 for k<0? Actually we treat negative indices as impossible so ignore them. So g(n)= mex of g(n-1) and g(n-4) for n>=4. For 1<=n<=3, handle separately. You compute g(0) =0, g(1)=1, g(2)=0, g(3)=1, g(4)=2, and then find pattern repeating every 5. So P-positions: g(n)=0 -> n\u22610 or 2 mod5. Counting yields 808.\n\nWe might also produce alternative proof by induction: state \"Claim: n is P iff n mod5 is 0 or 2\" and prove by induction.\n\nProof: Base cases n=0,1,2,3,4 verified. Inductive step: Suppose for all k<n, claim holds. Then n is P if and only if n-1 and n-4 are N, that is, if n-1\u22600,2 mod5 and n-4\u22600,2 mod5. That is, n-1\u22600 or 2 mod5 and n-4\u22600 or 2 mod5. Evaluate all possibilities modulo 5 leads to same pattern.\n\nBut easier: we derived pattern from Grundy numbers. So answer.\n\nThus we produce final answer 808.\n\nNow we need to respond with final answer boxed. Let's double-check the count again:\n\nNumber of numbers \u2264 2024 that are congruent to 0 mod5: floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers.\n\nNumber of numbers \u2264 2024 that are congruent to 2 mod5: floor((2024-2)/5) + 1? Usually for 2 mod 5 we get floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404+1? Wait careful:\n\nGeneral formula: The number of integers \u2264 N that are congruent to r mod m is floor((N-r)/m)+1 if r <= N. Because the smallest such number is r (\u22651) but r could be 0 but we exclude 0.\n\nBut we want positive integers \u22642024 and r=2. For N=2024.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., upto \u22642024. The difference between successive terms is 5. So count is floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405? Wait: 2022/5 = 404.4, floor=404. Then +1 => 405. That seems suspicious because previous reasoning gave 404 numbers. Let's compute explicit: 2,7,12,..., up to 2022 inclusive. Let's count:\n\nLet n_k = 2 + 5(k-1). We want n_k <= 2024. Solve 2 + 5(k-1) <=2024 => 5(k-1) <= 2022 => k-1 <= 404.4 => k <= 405.4. So k <= 405. So maximum integer k = 405. So there are 405 numbers? Wait: That gives k from 1 to 405 inclusive. So total 405. But earlier we thought 404. Let's double-check manually:\n\nLet's list a few terms: k=1 => 2; k=2 => 7; k=3 => 12; ... increments of 5.\n\nCheck k=405: n_405 = 2 + 5(404) = 2 + 2020 = 2022. That's \u22642024. So 405 values. But earlier we used floor(2024/5) = 404 for 0 mod5. For 2 mod5, maybe it's 404+1 =405. So that means total count of P-positions is 404 + 405 = 809, not 808.\n\nWait earlier we counted 404 numbers for each, but maybe the 2 mod5 should indeed be 405.\n\nLet's double-check careful arithmetic.\n\nCount of n <= N with n \u2261 a (mod m) for 1 <= a <= m, where a may be 0 (for 0 mod m). But we consider positive a.\n\nGeneral formula: number of solutions to n \u2261 r (mod m), 1 <= n <= N, r between 1 and m inclusive. Count = floor((N - r)/m) + 1 if r <= N. But if r > N, then zero. For r = 2, N = 2024. Compute floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404 + 1 = 405. Because floor(2022/5) = 404 (since 5*404 = 2020, remainder 2). So indeed 405 numbers.\n\nBut earlier we incorrectly computed as 404 due to misinterpreting floor(2024/5) = 404. But that formula is for r = 0 mod m? Let's check: Count of n \u2261 0 (mod 5) from 1 to 2024.\n\nn = 5k, k positive integer, <= 2024 -> 5k <= 2024 => k <= 404.8 => k <= 404. So there are 404 numbers for 0 mod 5. That is correct.\n\nNow count of n \u2261 2 mod 5: n = 5k+2, k >=0, <=? Wait when k=0, n=2 -> allowed. When k=404, n=5*404+2=2022. That's allowed. When k=405, n=5*405+2=2027 > 2024, not allowed. So k ranges from 0 to 404 inclusive => 405 values. So indeed there are 405 numbers.\n\nYes, so the total P-positions count is 404+405=809.\n\nThus earlier mis count: 808 vs 809. Let's double-check again to avoid mis counts.\n\nNow we must check potential double counting if any number is both 0 mod 5 and 2 mod 5? No. So it's fine. Sum = 809.\n\nBut we need to double-check the number of P-positions found for small n: For n <=10: P positions: 0,2,5,7. So positive ones: 2,5,7 => 3 numbers.\n\nOur formula would give: floor(10/5) = 2 numbers with 0 mod5: {5,10}. Wait 10 is also P? Let's confirm n=10 is P. So 0 mod5 numbers <=10: {5,10} => 2. Non-zero.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 <=10: {2,7} => 2. That yields 2 + 2 =4 positive P positions? But from enumeration earlier, we had P positive positions: 2,5,7. Wait we forgot 10 as P? We had that 10 is P earlier. Let's check earlier table: 10 is P indeed. So P positions up to 10: 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers, matches our formula: 2 + 2 =4. Good.\n\nSo formula holds for small N.\n\nNow test for N=15: P positions: we listed earlier 2,5,7,10,12,15. That's 6 numbers. 0 mod5 <=15: {5,10,15} => 3. 2 mod5 <=15: {2,7,12} => 3. Sum = 6. Good.\n\nThus the pattern is consistent.\n\nNow we compute for N=2024: 0 mod5 <=2024: 5,10,...,2020. That's 404 numbers as computed: floor(2024/5)=404. Because 5*404=2020. 0 mod5 numbers <=2024 count = 404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 <=2024: 2,7,...,2022. Count = floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404 +1=405. So total P positive positions count=404+405 = 809.\n\nThus Bob can win for 809 starting token counts.\n\nBut earlier we derived that the period might be 5, indeed.\n\nLet's confirm period 5 yields 5 possible residue classes. If g(n) pattern is 0,1,0,1,2 repeating, then g(n)=0 (P) at residues 0 and 2 mod 5. So there are 2 out of 5 residues that are P. So probability that a random n <= 2024 is P is approx 2/5. So approximate count of N <=2024: 2024*(2/5) = 1616.8, but we must count precisely. 2024 /5 = 404.8. Multiply by 2 => 809.6? Wait 404.8*2 = 809.6? Actually 404.8*2 = 809.6, but number must be integer. Real count is 809. That matches. Because 2024 not divisible by 5 exactly. For n=2024, there are floor(N/5)*2 + extra for remainder beyond floor(N/5)*5. Let's compute precisely: floor(N/5)=404, remainder R = 4. For each complete block of five numbers, there are 2 P values. That's 404*2=808. Then we need to consider the last partially block: numbers 2020+1=2021, 2022, 2023, 2024. Among those, P at the positions that are 2 mod5 or 0 mod5 beyond 2020: The numbers in that block: 2021 \u22611 mod5; 2022 \u22612 mod5 => P; 2023 \u22613 mod5; 2024 \u22614 mod5. So within the final remainder of 4 numbers, only 2022 is P. So add 1. So total 808+1=809. Good. So indeed 809.\n\nThus answer: 809.\n\nBut we need to reflect on the earlier error: we incorrectly counted 404+404. That miscount would produce 808. Let's verify with quick enumeration for n <= 30: The P positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30. That's 12 positions. According to our formula, 0 mod5 <=30: {5,10,15,20,25,30} => 6. 2 mod5 <=30: {2,7,12,17,22,27} => 6. Sum=12. Good. So 0 mod5 and 2 mod5 yield same count for N=30. For general N the counts differ by at most 1.\n\nTherefore 809 answer is correct.\n\nBut the earlier mis-calc came from incorrectly counting 2 mod5 as 404. So we correct.\n\nThus final answer is 809.\n\nNow the question: \"Find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\" That is the same as counting P-positions.\n\nThus answer: number is 809.\n\nDouble-check: Could we consider n=0 as positive? No. They said positive integers n. So n has to be at least 1. 0 is not counted. So we should not include n=0. But we should check if 0 mod5 positions start at 5: 5,10,..., which are all positive. So it's fine. And 2 mod5 start at 2: 2,7,..., all positive. So we counted correctly.\n\nThus 809. Let's produce final answer with explanation of pattern and counting.\n\nNow produce final output:\n\n\"Let g(n) be the Grundy number for n. g(0)=0. For n\u22651, g(n)=mex{g(n\u22121),g(n\u22124)}. Compute sequence: ... repeating period 5: 0,1,0,1,2. Thus g(n)=0 (P) iff n\u22610 or 2 (mod 5). Hence Bob wins precisely when n \u22610 or 2 (mod 5). Counting those n \u22642024: For n\u22610 (mod 5) we have 404 numbers (5,10,\u2026,2020). For n\u22612 (mod 5) we have 405 numbers (2,7,12,\u2026,2022). Total 404+405=809. So answer is \\boxed{809}.\"\n\nBut we need to be mindful of possible misinterpretation: maybe the game ends when no tokens remain; a player removes last token and wins. Our classification is correct: n=0 => previous player wins. So P-positions as described.\n\nCheck if there's any nuance: \"The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either 1 token or 4 tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins.\" This is a normal play Nim. So yes.\n\nThus answer stands as 809.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n\nBut the assistant must format answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nSo deliver final solution with explanation.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's create final answer.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Let \\(S=\\{1,4\\}\\) be the set of legal moves.  \nDefine the Sprague\u2011Grundy value (the nim\u2011value) \\(g(n)\\) of a heap of \\(n\\) tokens by  \n\n\\[\ng(0)=0,\\qquad   \ng(n)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{\\,g(n-1),\\,g(n-4)\\,\\}\\qquad(n\\ge 1)\n\\]\n\n(with the convention that an illegal subtraction is ignored).  \nThe position is a losing one for the player to move (a *P\u2011position*) iff \\(g(n)=0\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1.  Computing the sequence\n\nCalculate the first few values:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccccccccccccc}\nn & 0&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14\\\\ \\hline\ng(n)&0&1&0&1&2&0&1&0&1&2&0&1&0&1&2\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe values repeat every 5 steps:  \n\n\\[\ng(n)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 &\\text{if }n\\equiv0\\text{ or }2\\pmod 5,\\\\[4pt]\n1 &\\text{if }n\\equiv1\\text{ or }3\\pmod 5,\\\\[4pt]\n2 &\\text{if }n\\equiv4\\pmod 5.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nThus a heap is a P\u2011position (losing for the player to move) iff  \n\n\\[\nn\\equiv0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\text{or}\\quad n\\equiv2\\pmod 5 .\n\\]\n\nSince Alice starts, Bob wins exactly when \\(n\\) is a P\u2011position.\n\n---\n\n### 2.
