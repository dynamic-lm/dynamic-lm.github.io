            "value": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about Alice and Bob coloring points on a circle. The circle has N equally spaced points, numbered 0 to N-1. Alice starts at point 0, Bob at point K. They take turns coloring points black, but each move must maintain symmetry with respect to the line connecting the current player to the center. The question is whether all points can be colored black in the end, given that both play optimally to maximize the total colored points.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the symmetry condition. When a player colors a point, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to the line through that player and the center. So, for example, if Alice is at point 0, then any move she makes must be such that the new black point is symmetric with respect to the line through 0 and the center. Wait, but the line connecting the operator (the player) and the center. So, for Alice's move, the line is from her position (point 0) to the center. Since the points are on a circle, the line through 0 and the center would be the line passing through 0 and the center. So the symmetry here would be reflection across that line. So, when Alice colors a point, she must choose a point that is symmetric with respect to that line. Wait, but since the line passes through 0 and the center, the reflection of any point across that line would be... Well, the line is a straight line through the center and point 0. So, for example, if the circle is divided into points, then the reflection of a point across that line would be the point that's diametrically opposite to it with respect to that line. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For example, if the circle is like a clock, and the line is through 0 (say, 12 o'clock) and the center. Then, reflecting a point across that line would be the same as the point's mirror image. For example, point 1 would be mirrored to point 5 (if N is 6). Wait, because the line through 0 and the center is the vertical line. So, for N=6, the points are at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The line through 0 and the center is the vertical line. The reflection of point 1 would be point 5, since they are symmetric across that line. Similarly, point 2 would reflect to point 4. Point 3 is on the line, so it reflects to itself.\n\nSo, when Alice makes a move, she must color a point that is symmetric with respect to her line. But since she's at point 0, the line is through 0 and the center. So, when she colors a point, the symmetry requires that the point she colors is mirrored across that line. Wait, but the problem says that after the operation, the coloring must be symmetric. So, when Alice colors a point, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to her line. So, that implies that if she colors a point x, then the symmetric point of x with respect to her line must also be colored. But since she's the first to color, she can only color one point. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is all white. So, when Alice colors a point, she has to choose a point such that after coloring it, the entire set is symmetric. But since it's the first move, the only way to have symmetry is to color a point that is symmetric to itself. Because otherwise, if she colors x, then the symmetric point of x must also be colored. But since it's the first move, that's not possible unless x is symmetric to itself. So that implies that Alice must color a point that is symmetric to itself with respect to her line. Which would be the points on the line. For example, in the case of N=6, the line through 0 and the center would include points 0 and 3. So, Alice can only color point 0 or 3. But since the initial state is all white, she can't color point 0 (since it's already white, but maybe she can color it. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that they color a white point. So, Alice's first move must be to color a point that is symmetric with respect to her line. But since the initial state is all white, the only way to have symmetry is to color a point that is symmetric to itself. Because otherwise, if she colors x, then the symmetric point of x must also be colored. But since it's the first move, that's not possible. Therefore, Alice can only color points that are on her line of symmetry. So for her first move, she can choose to color either 0 or 3 (if N=6). But since the problem says that Alice starts at point 0, perhaps she can choose to color 0? Wait, but the problem says that the initial state is all white, so she can color point 0. But then, after that, the coloring is symmetric. Because the line of symmetry is through 0 and the center. So, the point 0 is on that line, so the coloring is symmetric. But then, when Bob takes his turn, he must color a point that is symmetric with respect to his line. But Bob is at point K. Wait, but Bob's line is determined by his position. Wait, the problem says that each operation must be symmetric with respect to the line connecting the operator (the current player) and the center. So, when Bob takes his turn, he must color a point that is symmetric with respect to his line. But Bob's line is the line through his current position (which is K) and the center. So, for example, if Bob is at K, then when he colors a point, he must choose a point that is symmetric with respect to that line. But again, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric after the operation.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Let's think about the process. Each move must add a point such that the entire set is symmetric with respect to the line of the current player. So, for example, when Alice colors a point, she must choose a point that is symmetric with respect to her line. But since the set is initially empty, the only way to have symmetry is to color a point that is on her line. Because otherwise, the symmetric point would not be colored, which would break symmetry. Therefore, Alice's first move must be to color a point on her line. So for Alice's first move, the possible points are those that are symmetric with respect to her line. Which for her line (through 0 and the center) are the points that are on that line. For example, in N=6, the line through 0 and the center passes through points 0 and 3. So Alice can color 0 or 3. But since the initial state is all white, she can color either. But when she colors 0, then the set is symmetric. Then Bob's turn comes. Now, Bob's line is through his position (which is K) and the center. Let's take the sample input where N=6, K=2. In that case, Bob is at position 2. So his line is through 2 and the center. The line passes through 2 and the center. The symmetry here would be that any point colored by Bob must be symmetric with respect to this line. But the current set of colored points is {0} (assuming Alice colored 0). So Bob needs to color a point such that the entire set is symmetric with respect to his line. So, the current set is {0}. The line is through 2 and center. The symmetric of 0 with respect to this line would be some point. Let's think: for N=6, the line through 2 and the center. Let's imagine the circle as a clock. The line through 2 and the center would be a line that passes through point 2 (which is at 60 degrees from 0?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry for Bob's line would require that if he colors a point x, then the symmetric of x with respect to his line is also colored. But since the current set is {0}, Bob can't color any point unless the symmetric of x is already colored. But since the set is {0}, the only way for Bob to color a point is to choose a point x such that x's symmetric is already in the set. But 0's symmetric with respect to Bob's line (through 2) is some point. Let me think. For example, in N=6, the line through 2 and center. The points are arranged in a circle. The line through 2 and the center would divide the circle into two halves. The symmetric of a point x with respect to this line would be the point that is mirrored across this line. For example, point 2 is on the line, so its symmetric is itself. What about point 0? Let's imagine the line through 2 and the center. The line would pass through 2 and the center. So, for N=6, the points are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The line through 2 and center would pass through 2 and the center. So, the reflection of point 0 across this line would be point 4? Because if you imagine the line passing through 2 and the center (which is the same as the line passing through 2 and 3 (since 3 is opposite to 0?), no. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of angles. Let me think of the circle as having points at angles 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 300\u00b0, etc. For N=6. So, point 0 is at 0\u00b0, point 1 at 60\u00b0, point 2 at 120\u00b0, point 3 at 180\u00b0, point 4 at 240\u00b0, point 5 at 300\u00b0. The line through point 2 (120\u00b0) and the center is the line that goes through 120\u00b0. The reflection of a point across this line would be such that the angle between the original point and the line is the same as the angle between the reflected point and the line, but on the other side. So, for example, point 0 is at 0\u00b0, which is 120\u00b0 from the line. The reflection would be a point that's 120\u00b0 on the other side of the line. Let me calculate. The line is at 120\u00b0, so the angle between the line and the original point (0\u00b0) is 120\u00b0 - 0\u00b0 = 120\u00b0, but perhaps I should think in terms of the angle between the line and the original point. Alternatively, perhaps the reflection of point x across the line through point K and the center can be determined by some formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the symmetric point. For example, for any point x, the symmetric point with respect to the line through K and the center can be calculated. Let's think about the circle as a circle with N points. The line through K and the center divides the circle into two halves. For any point x, its symmetric point y with respect to this line is such that the line connecting x and y is perpendicular to the line through K and the center, and the midpoint of x and y lies on the line through K and the center. \n\nBut how to compute this? Well, perhaps the symmetric point of x with respect to the line through K and the center is (2*K - x) mod N. Wait, that might not be correct. Let's think for N=6, K=2. Let's take x=0. Then 2*K -x = 4, which is point 4. So the symmetric of 0 would be 4. Let's check if that makes sense. The line through K=2 and the center. The symmetric of 0 would be 4. So, if Bob is at K=2, and he colors 4, then the symmetric point would be 0. But since 0 is already colored (by Alice), that's okay. So Bob can color 4. Then the set {0,4} is symmetric with respect to the line through 2 and the center. Because 0 and 4 are symmetric. So that seems correct. \n\nSo, for a general K, the symmetric of x with respect to the line through K and the center is (2*K - x) mod N. Wait, but maybe there's a better way to think about it. Let's think of the line through K and the center as the line that passes through K and the center. For any point x, the symmetric point y would be such that K is the midpoint between x and y. Because if you reflect x over the line through K and the center, then the line through K and the center is the axis of symmetry. So, the midpoint of x and y is on the axis. So, the midpoint between x and y is K. Therefore, K = (x + y) / 2 mod N. Wait, but since we are dealing with modular arithmetic, perhaps we can write y = 2*K -x mod N. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So for any x, the symmetric point y is (2*K -x) mod N. So, for example, when K is 2 and x is 0, y is 4, which is correct. \n\nSo, when a player colors a point x, the symmetric point y must also be colored. But since the player is coloring x, they must have already colored y, or else the symmetry would not be maintained. Wait, but the problem says that after the operation, the coloring must be symmetric. So, when a player colors x, the entire set must be symmetric. So, if x is colored, then the symmetric point y must also be colored. But since the player is coloring x, that implies that y is not yet colored. Therefore, the only way for the coloring to be symmetric is that x is symmetric to itself. Which would mean that x is on the axis of symmetry. Because if x is not on the axis, then its symmetric point y would be different from x, and since y is not yet colored, the set would not be symmetric. \n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me think again. Suppose the player is at K. When they color a point x, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to the line through K and the center. So, if x is colored, then y (its symmetric point) must also be colored. But since the player is coloring x, and y is not yet colored, this would not be possible. Therefore, the only way for the player to color x is that x is symmetric to itself. Which implies that x is on the axis of symmetry. Because if x is on the axis, then its symmetric point is itself. So, in that case, coloring x would make the set symmetric. \n\nWait, but that would mean that each move must color a point on the axis of symmetry of the current player. So, for example, when Alice starts, she is at position 0. The axis is through 0 and the center. So, she can only color points that are on that axis. Which are points 0 and (N/2) if N is even. For example, in N=6, the axis passes through 0 and 3. So, Alice can color 0 or 3. \n\nSo, when Alice colors a point, she must choose a point on her axis. Then, when Bob takes his turn, he is at position K. His axis is through K and the center. So, he must color a point on that axis. \n\nBut this seems to imply that each move must color a point on the axis of the current player. So, the players are alternately choosing points on their respective axes. \n\nBut how does this affect the overall process? Let's think about the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1: N=6, K=2. \n\nSample Output is Yes. \n\nIn the explanation, Alice colors 3 first. Wait, but according to the previous reasoning, Alice's axis is through 0 and 3. So, she can color 0 or 3. So, coloring 3 is allowed. Then, Bob's axis is through K=2 and the center. The axis would pass through 2 and 3 (since N=6, the opposite of 2 is 2 + 3 = 5? Wait, perhaps the axis for K=2 is through 2 and the center. The symmetric points on that axis would be 2 and (2*2 - 2) mod 6 = 2. So, the axis includes 2 and the center. Wait, but for N=6, the axis through K=2 and the center would pass through 2 and 3 (since 3 is the opposite of 0). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nBut according to the earlier formula, the symmetric point of x with respect to the axis of K is (2*K -x) mod N. So, for K=2, the symmetric of 2 is (4 - 2) mod 6 = 2. So, 2 is on the axis. So, the axis includes all points that are symmetric to themselves with respect to K's axis. Which would be points x where x = (2*K -x) mod N \u2192 2x \u2261 2K mod N \u2192 x \u2261 K mod N/2. So, perhaps the axis of symmetry for K is the line that passes through K and the center. So, the points on that axis are those that are symmetric to themselves. For example, K is on the axis. Also, the point opposite to K (if N is even) would be on the axis. \n\nBut regardless, each move must color a point that is on the axis of the current player. \n\nSo, for Alice's first move, she can choose any point on her axis (0 and 3 for N=6). Let's say she chooses 3. Then, the set is {3}. Now, Bob's turn. His axis is through K=2. He can choose any point on his axis. The points on his axis would be those that are symmetric to themselves with respect to the axis through K=2. For example, the symmetric of x with respect to K's axis is (2K -x) mod N. So, for x to be on the axis, x must equal (2K -x) mod N \u2192 2x \u2261 2K mod N \u2192 x \u2261 K mod (N/2). \n\nBut for N=6 and K=2, 2x \u2261 4 mod 6 \u2192 x \u2261 2 mod 3. So x can be 2 or 5 (since 2+3=5). Wait, 5 mod 3 is 2. So, the points on the axis are 2 and 5? Or perhaps I'm getting the math wrong. Let me compute for N=6, K=2. \n\nThe axis is through K=2 and the center. So, the points on this axis are those that are symmetric to themselves. So, for x to be on the axis, (2K -x) mod N = x. \n\nSo 2K -x \u2261 x mod N \u2192 2K \u2261 2x mod N \u2192 K \u2261 x mod N/2. \n\nSo for N=6, K=2, x must be congruent to 2 mod 3. So possible x values are 2 and 5 (since 2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod 3 is 2). So the points on Bob's axis are 2 and 5. \n\nSo Bob can choose to color either 2 or 5. Let's say he chooses 2. Then the set is {3, 2}. Now, the next move is Alice's. Her axis is through 0 and 3. She can choose points on that axis. The points on that axis are 0 and 3. But 3 is already colored. So she can choose 0. Then the set is {0, 2, 3}. Then Bob's turn. His axis is through 2. He can choose points on his axis (2 and 5). 2 is already colored. So he can choose 5. Then the set is {0, 2, 3, 5}. Then Alice's turn. Her axis is 0 and 3. She can choose points on that axis. 0 and 3 are already colored. So she can't choose any. Wait, but then the next move would be Bob's. But he has to choose a point on his axis. The points on his axis are 2 and 5. Both are already colored. So he can't move. So the total colored points are 4, which is less than 6. But the sample says that for N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. Because the sample input for N=6 and K=2 is possible to color all points. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the symmetry condition. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says that after the operation, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to the line connecting the operator and the center. \n\nSo, when a player colors a point, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to that line. \n\nSo, for example, when Alice colors a point x, then the entire set must be symmetric with respect to her line. So, the set must include the symmetric of x. But since it's the first move, the only way this is possible is if x is symmetric to itself. Because otherwise, the symmetric point is not colored. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that each move must color a point that is symmetric to itself with respect to the current player's line. Which means that the point is on the line. \n\nBut then, when Alice colors a point on her line, the set becomes symmetric. Then, when Bob colors a point on his line, the set must be symmetric with respect to his line. \n\nBut the set may not be symmetric with respect to both lines. Wait, but the problem says that the operation must be symmetric with respect to the current player's line. So, each move must satisfy the symmetry condition for the current player's line. \n\nSo, for example, after Alice colors point 3 (on her line), the set {3} is symmetric with respect to her line. Then, Bob's move must make the set symmetric with respect to his line. So, Bob can color a point that is symmetric to itself with respect to his line. \n\nBut if Bob colors a point that is symmetric to itself, then the set {3, x} must be symmetric with respect to his line. But how can that be? For example, if Bob colors point 2 (which is on his line), then the set {3, 2} must be symmetric with respect to his line. \n\nBut the line through Bob's position (2) and the center. So, the set {3, 2} must be symmetric with respect to that line. \n\nBut the line through 2 and the center. For the set {2,3}, the symmetry would require that each point has its symmetric counterpart. So, for point 2, it's on the line, so it's symmetric. For point 3, its symmetric point with respect to Bob's line is (2*2 -3) mod 6 = (4-3) mod 6 = 1. But 1 is not colored. So the set {2,3} is not symmetric with respect to Bob's line. Therefore, Bob cannot color 3. \n\nWait, this is a problem. So, Bob's move must color a point x such that the entire set of colored points is symmetric with respect to his line. So, when Bob colors a point x, the symmetric of x with respect to his line must already be in the set. Or, x must be symmetric to itself. \n\nSo, if Bob colors x, then the symmetric of x must be already in the set, or x is on the line. \n\nWait, but the set before Bob's move is {3}. So, when Bob colors x, the new set is {3, x}. For this new set to be symmetric with respect to Bob's line, the symmetric of x must be in the set. \n\nSo, for example, if Bob colors x=1, then the symmetric of x with respect to his line is (2*2 -1) mod 6 = 3. Which is already in the set. So, the new set {3, 1} is symmetric with respect to Bob's line. Because for each point, its symmetric is present. \n\nAh! So, Bob can color x=1. Because then, the symmetric of x is 3, which is already in the set. \n\nSo, this changes the earlier reasoning. \n\nSo, the key insight is that when a player colors a point x, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to the current player's line. Therefore, the set must include the symmetric of x. But since the player is adding x, the symmetric of x must already be in the set. Or, x is symmetric to itself (so, on the line). \n\nWait, but in the case where the player adds x, and the symmetric of x is not in the set. Then, the set would not be symmetric. So, the only way for the set to be symmetric is that the symmetric of x is already in the set. \n\nBut that would mean that the player can only color points x for which their symmetric is already in the set. \n\nBut then, how can the first move be made? \n\nFor Alice's first move, the set is empty. She needs to color x such that the set {x} is symmetric with respect to her line. That requires that the symmetric of x is already in the set. But since the set is empty, the only possibility is that x's symmetric is x itself. Which implies that x is on the line. \n\nSo, Alice can only color points that are on her line. \n\nSo, for example, in the first move, Alice can choose to color 0 or 3 (for N=6). \n\nThen, after that, Bob's move. Let's say Alice colored 3. Now, Bob's line is through K=2. He can choose any x such that the symmetric of x is already in the set. \n\nThe set is {3}. The symmetric of x with respect to Bob's line is (2*2 -x) mod 6. So, if Bob wants to color x, then (2*2 -x) mod 6 must be in the set. \n\nSo, (4 -x) mod 6 must be in {3}. \n\nSo, 4 -x \u2261 3 mod 6 \u2192 x \u2261 1 mod 6. \n\nSo, x=1. So Bob can color 1. Then, the set becomes {3, 1}, and since 1's symmetric is 3 (which is present), the set is symmetric with respect to Bob's line. \n\nSo, this is allowed. \n\nThen, Alice's turn. Her line is through 0 and 3. She can color a point x such that the symmetric of x is already in the set. The current set is {3,1}. \n\nSo, for Alice to color x, the symmetric of x must be in the set. \n\nThe symmetric of x with respect to Alice's line is (2*0 -x) mod 6 = (-x) mod 6. \n\nSo, the symmetric of x is (6 -x) mod 6. \n\nSo, for Alice to color x, (6 -x) mod 6 must be in the set {3, 1}. \n\nSo, possible x's: \n\nIf (6 -x) mod 6 is 3 \u2192 x mod 6 = 3 \u2192 x=3. But it's already colored. \n\nOr (6 -x) mod 6 is 1 \u2192 x mod 6 = 5 \u2192 x=5. \n\nSo, Alice can color 5. Then, the set becomes {3, 1, 5}. The symmetric of 5 is 1, which is present. So, the set is symmetric with respect to Alice's line. \n\nThen Bob's turn. His line is through 2. He can color x such that the symmetric of x is in the set. The set is {3, 1, 5}. \n\nThe symmetric of x with respect to Bob's line is (4 -x) mod 6. \n\nSo, (4 -x) must be in the set. \n\nSo, possible x values:\n\n4 -x = 3 \u2192 x=1 \u2192 already in set. \n\n4 -x = 1 \u2192 x=3 \u2192 in set. \n\n4 -x = 5 \u2192 x= (4 -5) mod 6 = -1 mod 6 = 5 \u2192 in set. \n\nSo, Bob can't color any new point. Wait, but the set is {3, 1, 5}. So, he can't color any new point. Because for any x not in the set, the symmetric of x must be in the set. \n\nBut wait, maybe he can color a point whose symmetric is already in the set. \n\nWait, for example, if he colors x=2 (which is on his line). Then the symmetric of 2 is 2. So, the set {3,1,5,2} is symmetric with respect to his line. Because the symmetric of 2 is 2 (already in the set). \n\nSo, Bob can color 2. Then the set is {3,1,5,2}. \n\nSo, this is allowed. \n\nThen, Alice's turn. Her line is through 0 and 3. She can color x such that the symmetric of x is in the set. The current set is {3,1,5,2}. \n\nThe symmetric of x with respect to Alice's line is (6 -x) mod 6. \n\nSo, for x to be added, (6 -x) must be in the set. \n\nWhich x's satisfy this? \n\nFor example, 6 -x is 3 \u2192 x=3 (already in set). \n\n6 -x is 1 \u2192 x=5 (already in set). \n\n6 -x is 5 \u2192 x=1 (already in set). \n\n6 -x is 2 \u2192 x=4. \n\nSo, x=4. \n\nSo, Alice can color 4. The symmetric of 4 is 6-4=2, which is in the set. \n\nSo, after coloring 4, the set is {3,1,5,2,4}. \n\nNow, Bob's turn. His line is through 2. He can color x such that the symmetric of x is in the set. \n\nThe symmetric of x is (4 -x) mod 6. \n\nThe current set is {3,1,5,2,4}. \n\nSo, possible x's: \n\nFor example, x=0. The symmetric of x is 4-0=4, which is in the set. So Bob can color 0. \n\nSo, the set becomes {3,1,5,2,4,0}. \n\nNow, all points are colored. \n\nSo, this is possible. \n\nSo, the key idea is that each move must add a pair of points (x and its symmetric), or a single point that is on the axis (which is symmetric to itself). \n\nBut since the players alternate, and they want to maximize the number of points colored, they will choose to color points in such a way that the maximum number of points can be colored. \n\nNow, the problem is to determine whether all points can be colored. \n\nSo, how do we model this? \n\nLet's think about the game. Each move adds a point x, which requires that the symmetric of x is already in the set. Or, x is on the axis of the current player. \n\nBut when a player adds a point x, which is not on their axis, then the symmetric of x must already be in the set. So, the player is adding a pair of points. \n\nBut in this case, since the player is adding x, the symmetric of x is already present. So, the player is adding x, which is the symmetric of some existing point. \n\nBut how does this affect the game? \n\nThe game is essentially about pairs of points. Each pair (x, y) where y is the symmetric of x. \n\nBut for a point x that is on the axis of a player, adding it is allowed, and it's a single point. \n\nBut the game is played by Alice and Bob, taking turns. \n\nThe total number of points that can be colored is determined by how many such pairs can be added, and whether the players can choose the order to color all points. \n\nBut since the players are cooperating to maximize the number of points, they will choose the optimal moves. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining whether the maximum possible number of points that can be colored is equal to N. \n\nBut how to compute that? \n\nLet's think about the structure of the points. \n\nEach point has a symmetric counterpart. Except for the points on the axis of symmetry. \n\nWait, for example, if N is even, then there are points that are on the axis of symmetry for some player. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to find for each point, whether it can be colored, given the players' choices. \n\nBut since the players are alternately adding points, and each move adds one point (but may be part of a pair), the problem becomes a game of selecting pairs of points. \n\nBut perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nThe total number of points that can be colored depends on the number of pairs that can be added. \n\nEach pair (x, y) can be added in one move by a player. But for that, the player must have the opportunity to add one of the points, and the other is already present. \n\nBut this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the entire game. \n\nEach move must add a point x such that the symmetric of x is already in the set. Or, x is on the axis of the current player. \n\nBut when a player adds a point x on their axis, that point is colored, and the set is symmetric with respect to their line. \n\nBut the other player's moves may not affect the symmetry of that line. \n\nBut the game is such that each move must maintain the symmetry with respect to the current player's line. \n\nBut the players are trying to maximize the number of points. \n\nSo, the game is determined by the parity of the number of pairs that can be added. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the number of points that can be colored. \n\nLet me think of the game as a series of moves where each move adds a pair of points (x and its symmetric) or a single point (if it's on the axis). \n\nBut since the players take turns, and they choose optimally, the game depends on the parity of the number of pairs and the positions of the points. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if the total number of points is even, or some other condition. \n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nSample 1: N=6, K=2 \u2192 output Yes. \n\nSample 2: N=6, K=3 \u2192 output No. \n\nSample 3: N=6, K=1 \u2192 output Yes. \n\nSample 4: N=200000, K=100000 \u2192 output No. \n\nSo, what's the pattern here? \n\nLet me think about the positions of the players. \n\nFor Alice, her initial position is 0. \n\nBob's initial position is K. \n\nBut the game depends on the positions of the players and how they can choose points. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to determine whether the number of points that can be colored is N. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of pairs. \n\nEach pair of points (x, y) can be added in two moves: one player adds x, and the other adds y. Or perhaps one player adds both points in one move? No, because each move adds one point. \n\nWait, no. Each move adds exactly one point. Because the player chooses one point to color. \n\nBut when a player adds a point x, the symmetric of x must already be in the set. So, adding x is allowed if the symmetric of x is already in the set. \n\nBut in that case, the symmetric of x is already present. So, the player is adding x, which is the symmetric of some existing point. \n\nBut then, the symmetric of x is already in the set. So, the player adds x, and the set is symmetric with respect to their line. \n\nBut this would imply that the pair (x, y) is added in one move. \n\nWait, no. Because the symmetric of x is already present. So, the player adds x, which is part of a pair. \n\nBut the total number of points added is one. \n\nBut how can this be? \n\nLet me think again. For example, in the case where the set is {3}, and Bob adds 1. The symmetric of 1 is 3, which is already present. So, the set becomes {3,1}. \n\nSo, the pair (1,3) is added in one move. \n\nBut how is that possible? Because Bob added 1, which is part of the pair. \n\nSo, the total number of points added is 1. \n\nBut the pair is completed. \n\nSo, each move adds exactly one point. \n\nBut the pair is completed when the symmetric point is added. \n\nBut how can this be? \n\nIt seems that the game is such that each move adds one point, and the symmetric of that point is already in the set. \n\nBut this implies that the pair (x, y) is already partially added. \n\nBut how does this work? \n\nLet me think of the process as follows. \n\nThe game starts with all points white. \n\nEach move, the player selects a point x that is white. \n\nAfter selecting x, the set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to the current player's line. \n\nSo, when the player selects x, the symmetric of x must already be in the set. Or x is on the line. \n\nSo, for x on the line, the set is symmetric. \n\nFor x not on the line, the symmetric of x must be already present. \n\nSo, the player is adding x, and the symmetric of x is already present. \n\nThis implies that the pair (x, symmetric(x)) is already partially colored. \n\nBut since the player is adding x, the symmetric of x must be already in the set. \n\nSo, the process is that each move adds one point, and the symmetric of that point is already present. \n\nBut how can the first move be made? \n\nOnly if the player adds a point on their line. \n\nSo, the first move is adding a point on Alice's line. \n\nThen, the second move is adding a point whose symmetric is already in the set. \n\nSo, for example, if Alice adds a point on her line, then Bob can add a point whose symmetric is already in the set. \n\nThis suggests that the game is a series of moves where each move adds a point whose symmetric is already present. \n\nBut then, the total number of points that can be colored is N. \n\nBut how to determine if that is possible. \n\nLet me think of the entire set of points. \n\nEach point has a symmetric point. Except for the points that are on the axis of symmetry. \n\nBut the axis of symmetry depends on the current player's line. \n\nBut this seems complicated. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe entire process must result in all points being colored. \n\nThis requires that the players can choose moves that add points in such a way that all points are colored. \n\nBut for this to be possible, the initial positions of Alice and Bob must allow for the game to proceed until all points are colored. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nLet me think about the symmetry of the entire circle. \n\nFor all points to be colored, the entire set must be symmetric with respect to both Alice's and Bob's lines. \n\nBut this is not necessarily the case. Because each move is symmetric with respect to the current player's line. \n\nBut the final state must be symmetric with respect to the last player's line. \n\nBut the final state must be symmetric with respect to all players' lines? Or just the last player's line? \n\nNo, because each move must have been symmetric with respect to the current player's line. So, the final state is symmetric with respect to the last player's line. \n\nBut the final state may not be symmetric with respect to other players' lines. \n\nBut the final state must have all points colored. \n\nBut how can that happen? \n\nFor example, in the sample input N=6, K=2. \n\nThe final state is all points colored. \n\nBut the final move is made by Bob, who added point 0. \n\nAt that time, the set was {3,1,5,2,4}, and Bob added 0. \n\nThe symmetric of 0 with respect to Bob's line (through 2) is (2*2 -0) mod 6 = 4. Which is already in the set. So, adding 0 is allowed. \n\nThe final state is symmetric with respect to Bob's line. \n\nBut what about Alice's line? \n\nThe final state includes all points. For Alice's line (through 0 and 3), the set is symmetric. Because every point has its symmetric counterpart. \n\nSo, the final state is symmetric with respect to both lines. \n\nBut how is this possible? \n\nBecause the entire set is symmetric with respect to both lines. \n\nBut this is only possible if the entire set is symmetric with respect to both lines. \n\nWhich implies that the entire set is symmetric with respect to the intersection of the two lines. \n\nBut the lines are Alice's line (through 0 and the center) and Bob's line (through K and the center). \n\nThe intersection of these two lines is the center. \n\nSo, for the entire set to be symmetric with respect to both lines, it must be symmetric with respect to the intersection of the lines. \n\nBut this is getting too abstract. \n\nLet me think of the entire process as follows: \n\nEach move adds a point x, which is either on the current player's line (so it's symmetric to itself) or has its symmetric already in the set. \n\nThe total number of points that can be colored is determined by the number of such moves that can be made. \n\nBut the players are trying to maximize the number of points. \n\nSo, the question is: can the players choose their moves such that all points are colored? \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nPerhaps the key is to find whether the number of points that can be colored is even or odd, based on the initial positions. \n\nAlternatively, think about the game as a series of pairs. \n\nEach pair (x, y) where x and y are symmetric points. \n\nThe total number of such pairs is floor(N/2). \n\nBut if N is even, then there are N/2 pairs. \n\nIf N is odd, then there are (N-1)/2 pairs, plus one point that is on the axis (the center point). \n\nBut for the entire set to be colored, all pairs must be added, and the center point (if N is odd) must be added. \n\nBut how does this relate to the players' moves? \n\nEach pair can be added in two moves: one by Alice and one by Bob. \n\nBut the players alternate. \n\nSo, the total number of pairs that can be added is determined by the parity of the number of pairs. \n\nBut perhaps the problem reduces to whether the number of pairs is even or odd, depending on the initial positions. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nLet me think of the sample input where N=6 and K=2. \n\nN=6 is even. There are 3 pairs. \n\nThe players need to add all 3 pairs. \n\nEach pair requires two moves. \n\nBut the players alternate. \n\nSo, the total number of moves is 6. \n\nBut the first move is Alice's, then Bob's, etc. \n\nSo, for 3 pairs, each requires two moves. \n\nTotal moves: 3 * 2 = 6. \n\nWhich is even. \n\nSo, Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice making the first move. \n\nSo, the total number of moves is 6. \n\nWhich is even. So, Alice and Bob each make 3 moves. \n\nBut how does this relate to the initial positions? \n\nBut the sample input N=6, K=3 has output No. \n\nFor N=6, K=3. \n\nLet's think. \n\nAlice starts at 0. Bob starts at 3. \n\nAlice's first move can be to color 0 or 3. \n\nLet's say she colors 0. \n\nBob's turn. His line is through 3. The symmetric of x with respect to Bob's line is (2*3 -x) mod 6 = (6 -x) mod 6. \n\nSo, Bob can choose to color a point whose symmetric is already in the set. \n\nThe set is {0}. \n\nThe symmetric of 0 with respect to Bob's line is 6-0=6 mod 6=0. Which is already in the set. \n\nSo, Bob can choose to color 0 again? No, because it's already colored. \n\nSo, Bob cannot color any point. \n\nWait, but he must choose a white point. \n\nSo, Bob's move must choose a white point x, such that the symmetric of x is in the set. \n\nThe set is {0}. \n\nSo, the symmetric of x must be 0. \n\nWhich implies that (6 -x) mod 6 = 0 \u2192 x mod 6 = 0 \u2192 x=0. But it's already colored. \n\nSo, Bob cannot make any move. \n\nThus, the game ends with only one point colored. \n\nSo, the answer is No. \n\nWhich matches the sample input. \n\nThis suggests that when K is such that Bob's line is the same as Alice's line, then it's possible that the game ends early. \n\nSo, what determines whether all points can be colored? \n\nLet's think about the following: \n\nThe entire game can be completed only if the players can choose moves that allow all pairs to be added. \n\nBut for this to be possible, the number of pairs must be such that the players can alternate adding them. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think about the number of pairs that can be added. \n\nEach pair requires two moves (one for each point). \n\nBut the players alternate. \n\nSo, if the total number of pairs is even, then Alice and Bob can each add half of the pairs. \n\nIf it's odd, then one player will add one more pair than the other. \n\nBut how does this relate to the initial positions? \n\nAlternatively, the game depends on whether the initial positions allow the players to take turns adding pairs. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to determine whether the number of pairs that can be added is even or odd, and whether the players can choose to add them. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nThe entire game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs that can be added is even or odd, depending on the initial positions. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nLet me think about the sample input N=6, K=2. \n\nThe total number of pairs is 3. \n\nBut how is this possible? \n\nIn the scenario where all points are colored, the number of moves is 6. \n\nWhich is even. \n\nSo, Alice and Bob each make 3 moves. \n\nBut how does this relate to the initial positions? \n\nPerhaps the key is to determine whether the number of pairs that can be added is such that the players can alternate adding them. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nLet me think of the game as follows: \n\nEach pair (x, y) can be added in two moves. \n\nThe players alternate adding the pairs. \n\nBut the players can choose which pair to add. \n\nBut the initial positions of Alice and Bob determine which pairs are available for them to add. \n\nFor example, if Alice starts, she can choose to add a point on her line. \n\nThis may allow her to add a pair that is symmetric to herself. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother observation: \n\nFor all points to be colored, the entire set must be symmetric with respect to the line through Alice's initial position (0) and the center. \n\nBecause the last move is made by Bob, and the final set must be symmetric with respect to his line. \n\nBut if the final set is symmetric with respect to both lines, then it is symmetric with respect to the intersection of the lines. \n\nBut what is the intersection of the lines through Alice's position (0) and Bob's position (K)? \n\nThe intersection is the center of the circle. \n\nSo, the final set must be symmetric with respect to the center. \n\nWhich means that for every point x, its symmetric with respect to the center is also colored. \n\nThe symmetric of x with respect to the center is (N - x) mod N. \n\nSo, for the final set to be symmetric with respect to the center, every point x must have its symmetric (N - x) also colored. \n\nThis is the condition for the entire set to be symmetric with respect to the center. \n\nBut this is required for the final set to be symmetric with respect to both Alice's and Bob's lines. \n\nBut how does this relate to the game? \n\nIf the entire set is symmetric with respect to the center, then it is possible that the game can be completed. \n\nBut how to determine whether this is possible. \n\nLet me think: \n\nFor the entire set to be symmetric with respect to the center, the number of points must be even. Or, if N is odd, the center point must be colored. \n\nBut in the sample input N=6 (even), all points are colored. \n\nIn the sample input N=6, K=3, the output is No. \n\nBut in that case, the initial positions are Alice at 0 and Bob at 3. \n\nThe line through Bob's position (3) and the center is the same as Alice's line (since for N=6, the line through 0 and the center is the same as the line through 3 and the center). \n\nSo, the players are on the same line. \n\nSo, when Alice adds a point on her line (like 0), Bob can add a point on his line (which is the same line). \n\nBut in this case, the game may not be able to proceed to color all points. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nPerhaps the key condition is whether the initial positions of Alice and Bob are on the same line through the center. \n\nIn other words, whether K is such that the line through K and the center is the same as the line through Alice's position (0) and the center. \n\nThis would happen if K is the opposite of 0, i.e., K = N/2. \n\nFor example, in N=6, K=3. \n\nSo, if K is equal to N/2, then Alice and Bob are on the same line. \n\nIn this case, the game may not be able to complete all points. \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause when Alice and Bob are on the same line, each move must be on that line. \n\nSo, for example, if Alice starts by coloring a point on the line (like 0), then Bob must color a point on the same line. \n\nBut the line has two points (0 and N/2). \n\nSo, after Alice colors 0, Bob can color N/2. \n\nThen, Alice can't color any more points on the line (since both are colored). \n\nSo, the game proceeds to other pairs. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of N=6, K=3. \n\nAlice's first move: color 0. \n\nBob's move: color 3. \n\nNow, the set is {0,3}. \n\nAlice's turn: she must choose a point on her line (0 and 3). Both are colored. So, she cannot move. \n\nGame ends. \n\nSo, only 2 points are colored. \n\nThus, the output is No. \n\nThis matches the sample input. \n\nSo, the condition for the game to end with all points colored is that the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nSo, the key is whether the initial positions of Alice and Bob are on the same line. \n\nIf they are, then the game may not be able to complete all points. \n\nOtherwise, it can. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nThe line through Alice's position (0) and the center is the line that contains 0 and N/2 (if N is even). \n\nThe line through Bob's position (K) and the center is the line that contains K and N/2 (if N is even). \n\nSo, for these lines to be the same, K must be either 0 or N/2. \n\nBut since K is given as between 1 and N-1, it can't be 0. So, the lines are the same if K = N/2. \n\nThus, the condition for the game to end with all points colored is that K is not equal to N/2. \n\nWait, but what about other cases? \n\nLet's take N=6, K=1. \n\nSample input says output is Yes. \n\nIn this case, K is 1, which is not N/2 (3). \n\nSo, the lines are different. \n\nSo, the game can proceed to color all points. \n\nSo, the sample input for N=6, K=1 is Yes. \n\nSo, the condition seems to be that K is not equal to N/2. \n\nBut what about when N is odd? \n\nFor example, N=5. Let's say K=2. \n\nN is odd, so there is no point on the line through Alice's position (0) and the center. \n\nWait, for N=5, the line through 0 and the center would pass through 0 and the center. But since N is odd, there is no point directly opposite to 0. \n\nSo, the line through 0 and the center would have only 0 as a point on it. \n\nSo, for Alice's first move, she can only color 0. \n\nBob's line is through K=2 and the center. \n\nSo, he can color points that are symmetric to themselves with respect to this line. \n\nBut for N=5, the symmetric of x with respect to the line through 2 and the center is (2*2 -x) mod 5 = (4 -x) mod 5. \n\nFor x to be on the line, x = (4 -x) mod 5 \u2192 2x \u22614 mod 5 \u2192 x \u2261 2 mod 5. So, x=2. \n\nSo, Bob can color 2. \n\nThen, the set is {0, 2}. \n\nAlice's turn: she must color a point on her line (0), which is already colored. So, she can't move. \n\nGame ends. \n\nSo, only 2 points are colored. \n\nBut this is not all points. \n\nSo, for N=5, K=2, the output would be No. \n\nBut this is just an example. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nThe key seems to be whether the players are on the same line. \n\nIf they are, then the game cannot complete all points. \n\nOtherwise, it can. \n\nBut how to check this. \n\nThe line through Alice's position (0) and the center is the line that contains 0 and the point opposite to 0, which is N/2 if N is even. \n\nFor N even, this line contains two points: 0 and N/2. \n\nFor N odd, this line contains only 0 (since there is no opposite point). \n\nSo, for the players to be on the same line, K must be equal to N/2 (if N is even). \n\nSo, the condition for the game to be able to color all points is that K is not equal to N/2 (when N is even). \n\nBut what about when N is odd? \n\nFor example, N=5, K=2. \n\nIn this case, the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut the game can't color all points. \n\nSo, this suggests that the condition is not just about whether K is N/2. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo, what's the general condition for all points to be colored? \n\nLet me think about the game again. \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the players can choose their moves such that all pairs are added. \n\nBut for this to happen, the players must have the ability to choose the pairs in such a way that the parity of the number of pairs allows for the game to proceed. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think about the number of pairs. \n\nFor N even: there are N/2 pairs. \n\nFor N odd: (N-1)/2 pairs, plus the center point. \n\nBut to color all points, the center point must be colored. \n\nBut how can this happen? \n\nFor example, in N=5, the center point is not a point, but for odd N, the center is between points. \n\nSo, there is no point that is on the axis of symmetry for all players. \n\nBut perhaps the center point is not a point, so it's not part of the game. \n\nSo, for N odd, the game can only color all points if the number of pairs is even? \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nLet me think about the sample input N=6, K=1. \n\nN is even. K=1 is not N/2 (3). \n\nSo, the players are on different lines. \n\nThe game can complete. \n\nBut how? \n\nIn this case, the players can alternate adding pairs. \n\nSo, for N even, the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. \n\nFor N odd, the condition is something else. \n\nBut what? \n\nLet's think about N=5, K=2. \n\nN is odd. \n\nThe players are on different lines. \n\nBut the game cannot complete. \n\nSo, what's the pattern here? \n\nMaybe the condition is that the number of pairs is even. \n\nFor N even, the number of pairs is N/2. \n\nFor N odd, it's (N-1)/2. \n\nBut for N=6, K=2, the number of pairs is 3 (odd), and the game can complete. \n\nFor N=5, the number of pairs is 2 (even), but the game cannot complete. \n\nSo this suggests that the number of pairs is not the determining factor. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nLet's think about the entire process. \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even, and the players can alternate adding them. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nAlternatively, the game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even and the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut this is not supported by the sample input. \n\nLet me think about N=6, K=1. \n\nNumber of pairs is 3 (odd). The game can complete. \n\nSo, this suggests that the number of pairs being odd is allowed. \n\nSo, this approach is incorrect. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs that can be added is such that the players can alternate adding them. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nThe players alternate moves. \n\nEach pair requires two moves. \n\nSo, for each pair, one move by Alice and one by Bob. \n\nIf the number of pairs is even, then Alice and Bob each make the same number of moves. \n\nIf the number of pairs is odd, then one player makes one more move. \n\nBut this depends on who starts. \n\nAlice starts first. \n\nSo, for the number of pairs being m, the total number of moves is 2m. \n\nIf m is even, then Alice and Bob each make m moves. \n\nIf m is odd, then Alice makes m+1 moves, and Bob makes m moves. \n\nBut how does this relate to the game being able to complete all points. \n\nBut this depends on the players being able to choose the pairs. \n\nBut how to determine whether this is possible. \n\nFor example, in N=6, K=2, the number of pairs is 3 (odd). Alice makes 2 moves, Bob makes 1? No, wait, total moves is 2*3=6. Alice makes 3 moves, Bob makes 3 moves. \n\nSo, the number of pairs is 3, which is odd. \n\nSo, the players alternate, and it's possible. \n\nBut in N=5, K=2, the number of pairs is 2 (even). \n\nBut the game cannot complete. \n\nSo, this suggests that the number of pairs is not the determining factor. \n\nPerhaps the key is whether the players can choose to add pairs in such a way that the game can proceed. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nLet me think about the initial positions. \n\nIf Alice and Bob are on different lines, then each player can add pairs from their own line. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother observation: \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even, or the number of pairs is odd and the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even or the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut this is also just a guess. \n\nLet me think of the sample inputs. \n\nSample 1: N=6, K=2. \n\nNumber of pairs is 3 (odd). Players are not on the same line. Output is Yes. \n\nSample 2: N=6, K=3. Players are on the same line. Output is No. \n\nSample 3: N=6, K=1. Players are not on the same line. Output is Yes. \n\nSample 4: N=200000, K=100000. K is N/2. Players are on the same line. Output is No. \n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that if K is equal to N/2, the output is No. Otherwise, it's Yes. \n\nBut what about when N is odd and K is not equal to N/2? \n\nLet's take N=5, K=1. \n\nN is odd. K is not N/2 (which is 2.5). \n\nSo, the players are not on the same line. \n\nCan all points be colored? \n\nLet's try to simulate. \n\nAlice starts at 0. Bob at 1. \n\nAlice's first move: she can color a point on her line. For N=5, the line through 0 and the center has only 0. So, she must color 0. \n\nNow, set is {0}. \n\nBob's turn. His line is through 1 and the center. The symmetric of x with respect to this line is (2*1 -x) mod 5 = (2 -x) mod 5. \n\nBob needs to choose a point x such that the symmetric of x is in the set. \n\nThe set is {0}. \n\nSo, (2 -x) mod 5 must be 0 \u2192 x = 2 mod 5. So, x=2. \n\nBob colors 2. Now, set is {0, 2}. \n\nAlice's turn. Her line is through 0. She can only color 0 (already colored). So, she can't move. \n\nGame ends. Only 2 points are colored. \n\nSo, output is No. \n\nBut according to the earlier hypothesis, since K is not equal to N/2, the output should be Yes. But in this case, it's No. \n\nSo, the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is not simply whether K is N/2. \n\nSo, what's the correct condition? \n\nLet me think about the game again. \n\nFor all points to be colored, the players must be able to add all pairs. \n\nBut for this to happen, the players must be able to choose pairs in such a way that each pair is added in two moves. \n\nBut how to ensure this. \n\nPerhaps the key is that the number of pairs is even. \n\nBut for N=6, K=2, the number of pairs is 3 (odd), and it's possible. \n\nSo, this is not the case. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even, or the number of pairs is odd and the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut this is not supported by the sample input. \n\nLet me think of N=6, K=2. \n\nNumber of pairs is 3 (odd). Players are not on the same line. Output is Yes. \n\nN=5, K=1. Number of pairs is 2 (even). Players are not on the same line. Output is No. \n\nSo, this suggests that the number of pairs is not the determining factor. \n\nAnother observation: \n\nThe game can be completed only if the players can choose to add pairs in such a way that the total number of moves is even. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nLet me think about the game as a series of moves. \n\nEach move adds one point. \n\nThe game ends when no more moves can be made. \n\nThe total number of points colored is the number of moves made. \n\nTo color all points, the total number of moves must be N. \n\nBut how to determine whether this is possible. \n\nLet me think about the game as a series of pairs and single points. \n\nFor example, if a player adds a point on their line, it's a single point. \n\nBut this is only possible if the line has such points. \n\nBut this seems complex. \n\nLet me think about the initial positions. \n\nAlice is at 0. Bob is at K. \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the players can add all points, and the number of moves is N. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of pairs. \n\nFor N even, the number of pairs is N/2. \n\nFor N odd, it's (N-1)/2. \n\nLet's assume that the players can add all pairs, and the number of moves is 2 * number of pairs. \n\nFor N even, this is N. \n\nFor N odd, this is N-1. \n\nBut for N odd, there is one point (the center) that is not part of any pair. \n\nBut how to add it. \n\nThis point can only be added if it is on the line of the current player. \n\nBut for N odd, the center is not a point. \n\nSo, this suggests that for N odd, it's impossible to add all points, because there is no single point to add. \n\nWait, but this is not true. \n\nFor example, if N=5, and the players can add all pairs. \n\nBut how? \n\nFor N=5, there are 2 pairs. \n\nEach pair requires two moves. Total of 4 moves. \n\nBut N=5, so 5 points. \n\nSo, it's impossible to color all points. \n\nThus, for N odd, it's impossible to color all points. \n\nBut this contradicts the sample input where N=6 (even) is possible. \n\nBut the sample input for N=6, K=2 is possible. \n\nSo, this suggests that for N odd, the answer is always No. \n\nBut let's check this. \n\nFor N=5, K=2, the game cannot complete. \n\nFor N=5, K=1, the game cannot complete. \n\nSo, for N odd, the answer is always No. \n\nBut what about N=1? Well, the constraints say N >= 2. \n\nSo, the condition is: \n\nIf N is odd, output No. \n\nIf N is even, then output Yes if K is not equal to N/2, otherwise No. \n\nLet's check this against the samples. \n\nSample 1: N=6 (even), K=2 (not 3) \u2192 Yes. \n\nSample 2: N=6, K=3 (equal to 3) \u2192 No. \n\nSample 3: N=6, K=1 (not 3) \u2192 Yes. \n\nSample 4: N=200000 (even), K=100000 (equal to N/2) \u2192 No. \n\nThis matches the samples. \n\nWhat about N=5 (odd) \u2192 output No. \n\nWhat about N=4, K=2 (N/2) \u2192 output No. \n\nFor N=4, K=1 (not N/2=2) \u2192 output Yes. \n\nLet's simulate N=4, K=1. \n\nN=4, K=1. \n\nAlice starts at 0. Bob at 1. \n\nAlice's first move: can color 0 or 2 (since for N=4, the line through 0 and center has 0 and 2). \n\nLet's say she colors 0. \n\nBob's turn: his line is through 1 and center. The symmetric of x with respect to this line is (2*1 -x) mod 4 = (2 -x) mod 4. \n\nHe needs to choose x such that (2 -x) mod 4 is in the set {0}. \n\nSo, 2 -x \u2261 0 mod 4 \u2192 x = 2 mod 4. \n\nSo, Bob colors 2. \n\nNow, set is {0, 2}. \n\nAlice's turn: she can choose to color 2 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, she can't move. \n\nGame ends with 2 points. \n\nWait, this suggests that the answer would be No, but according to our hypothesis, it should be Yes. \n\nBut this contradicts the hypothesis. \n\nSo, what's wrong here? \n\nAh, perhaps there's another way to play the game. \n\nLet me try a different sequence. \n\nAlice's first move: color 2 (on her line). \n\nSet is {2}. \n\nBob's turn: his line is through 1. \n\nHe needs to choose x such that (2 -x) mod 4 is in the set {2}. \n\nSo, 2 -x \u2261 2 mod 4 \u2192 x \u2261 0 mod 4. \n\nSo, Bob colors 0. \n\nSet is {2, 0}. \n\nAlice's turn: she can choose to color 0 or 2 (already colored). No move. \n\nGame ends with 2 points. \n\nStill, the answer would be No. \n\nBut according to our hypothesis, since N is even and K is not N/2, the answer should be Yes. \n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nSo, what's the correct condition? \n\nThis indicates that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nThis is getting very complicated. \n\nLet me think about the problem from a different angle. \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even, and the players can alternate adding them. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nLet me think about the game as a series of moves where each move adds one point from a pair. \n\nEach pair can be added in two moves: one by Alice and one by Bob. \n\nThe total number of pairs is m. \n\nIf m is even, then Alice and Bob each add m/2 pairs. \n\nIf m is odd, then Alice adds (m+1)/2 pairs and Bob adds (m-1)/2 pairs. \n\nBut this depends on who starts. \n\nSince Alice starts first, if m is odd, she will have one more move. \n\nBut for the game to be completed, the players must be able to choose the pairs in such a way that all pairs are added. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nLet me think about the initial positions. \n\nIf Alice and Bob are on the same line, then the game may not be able to complete all pairs. \n\nBut if they are not on the same line, it may be possible. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother observation: \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even, or the number of pairs is odd and the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLet me test this with the previous example. \n\nFor N=4, K=1: number of pairs is 2 (even). So, it should be possible. \n\nBut in the simulation, it's not possible. \n\nSo, this suggests that the condition is not correct. \n\nLet me think about another scenario for N=4, K=1. \n\nAlice's first move: color 2 (on her line). \n\nBob's move: he can color 0 (symmetric to 2). \n\nNow, set is {2, 0}. \n\nAlice's turn: she can choose to color 0 or 2 (already colored). No move. \n\nGame ends. \n\nBut there are two more pairs: (1, 3). \n\nBut how can they be added? \n\nAlice and Bob need to add these. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think: \n\nAfter the first two moves, the set is {0, 2}. \n\nAlice's turn: she can't move. \n\nBut Bob's turn: he can't move. \n\nSo, the game ends. \n\nSo, it's impossible to add the other pairs. \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause the players are not able to choose the other pairs. \n\nSo, the problem is not just about the number of pairs, but about the players' ability to choose the pairs. \n\nThis suggests that the initial positions of the players determine which pairs are available for them to add. \n\nFor example, in N=4, K=1, the line through Bob's position (1) and the center is the line through 1 and 3. \n\nThe pairs (1,3) can be added by Bob. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me try a different sequence. \n\nAlice's first move: color 0. \n\nBob's move: he can choose to color 1, since the symmetric of 1 is (2*1 -1) mod 4 = 1. So, it's on his line. \n\nWait, for Bob's line, the symmetric of x is (2*1 -x) mod 4 = (2 -x) mod 4. \n\nSo, if Bob chooses to color 1, the symmetric of 1 is (2 -1) mod 4 = 1. So, it's on his line. \n\nSo, Bob can color 1. \n\nNow, the set is {0, 1}. \n\nAlice's turn: she can choose to color 2 (on her line). \n\nSet becomes {0, 1, 2}. \n\nBob's turn: his line is through 1. He can choose to color 3, since the symmetric of 3 is (2 -3) mod 4 = (2 -3) = -1 mod 4 = 3. So, it's on his line. \n\nSo, Bob colors 3. \n\nNow, all points are colored. \n\nSo, this sequence works. \n\nAh! So, the previous simulation was incorrect. \n\nThe key is that the players can choose to add points on their line, which is a single point, and this allows the game to proceed. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the game can be completed. \n\nSo, for N=4, K=1, the answer is Yes. \n\nSo, the previous simulation was wrong because I didn't consider that the players can choose to add points on their line. \n\nSo, the condition is not just about the number of pairs, but about the players being able to add points on their line. \n\nSo, the correct condition is: \n\nThe game can be completed if and only if the number of pairs is even, or the number of pairs is odd and the players are not on the same line. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nLet me re-examine the earlier example. \n\nFor N=4, K=1: \n\nNumber of pairs is 2 (even). \n\nThe players are not on the same line. \n\nSo, it is possible to complete the game. \n\nFor N=6, K=2: number of pairs is 3 (odd), players are not on the same line \u2192 possible. \n\nFor N=4, K=2 (same line): number of pairs is 2 (even), but players are on the same line \u2192 not possible. \n\nSo, the condition is: \n\nIf N is even, then the answer is Yes if K is not equal to N/2, and No otherwise. \n\nIf N is odd, the answer is No. \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause for N even, if K is not equal to N/2, then the players are not on the same line, and they can alternate adding pairs and single points. \n\nFor N even, if K is equal to N/2, then the players are on the same line, and the game cannot complete. \n\nFor N odd, it's impossible to complete the game, because there is no single point to add. \n\nBut how to confirm this. \n\nLet's take N=4, K=2 (same line). \n\nAlice's first move: color 0 or 2. \n\nLet's say she colors 0. \n\nBob's turn: he is on the same line. So, he can color 2. \n\nNow, set is {0, 2}. \n\nAlice's turn: can't move. \n\nGame ends. \n\nSo, output is No. \n\nWhich matches the condition. \n\nSo, the condition is: \n\nIf N is even and K is not equal to N/2, output Yes. \n\nOtherwise, output No. \n\nFor N odd, output No. \n\nThis seems to fit all the samples and the examples I've tried. \n\nSo, the solution is to check if N is even and K is not equal to N/2. \n\nBut wait, what about N=4, K=1, which is even and K is not N/2 (2). The answer is Yes. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code should check for each test case:\n\nIf N is even and K is not equal to N/2 \u2192 output Yes. \n\nOtherwise, output No. \n\nBut wait, let's check the sample input N=6, K=3. \n\nN is even, K is 3 = 6/2 \u2192 output No. \n\nSample input N=6, K=2 \u2192 output Yes. \n\nSample input N=6, K=1 \u2192 output Yes. \n\nSample input N=200000, K=100000 \u2192 output No. \n\nThis matches the sample outputs. \n\nSo, this seems to be the correct condition. \n\nSo, the code can be written as follows: \n\nFor each test case, if N is even and K is not equal to N/2, then output Yes. Otherwise, output No. \n\nBut wait, what about N=4, K=2? \n\nN is even, K is N/2 \u2192 output No. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about N=2, K=1? \n\nN is even, K is 1, which is not 1 (since N/2 is 1). So, K is equal to N/2. \n\nWait, N=2, N/2 is 1. K=1. So, output No. \n\nBut let's see: \n\nN=2, K=1. \n\nAlice is at 0, Bob at 1. \n\nAlice's first move: she can color 0 (on her line). \n\nBob's turn: his line is through 1. He can color 1 (on his line). \n\nNow, all points are colored. \n\nSo, output should be Yes. \n\nBut according to the condition, since K is equal to N/2 (1), the output is No. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nSo, what's wrong here? \n\nIn this case, N=2, K=1. \n\nThe line through Alice's position (0) and the center is the line through 0 and 1 (since N=2, the center is between 0 and 1). \n\nBob's line is through 1 and the center. \n\nSo, the lines are the same. \n\nBut in this case, the game can be completed. \n\nSo, the condition is incorrect. \n\nSo, what is the correct condition? \n\nFor N=2, K=1: \n\nAlice colors 0. \n\nBob colors 1. \n\nAll points are colored. \n\nSo, output should be Yes. \n\nBut according to the previous condition, since K is N/2 (1), output is No. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is incorrect. \n\nSo, what's the correct condition? \n\nLet me re-examine the condition. \n\nThe previous condition was that for N even, if K is not equal to N/2, output Yes, else No. \n\nBut in this case, N=2, K=1 (which is N/2), but the answer is Yes. \n\nSo, the condition is wrong. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is not simply whether K is N/2. \n\nSo, what is the correct condition? \n\nLet me think about the case when N is even and K is N/2. \n\nIn this case, the players are on the same line. \n\nBut in N=2, K=1, the game can be completed. \n\nSo, the condition must be different. \n\nLet me think about the general case when N is even and K is N/2. \n\nIn this case, the players are on the same line. \n\nBut the game can be completed if the number of points is 2. \n\nFor N=2, K=1, the game can be completed. \n\nFor N=4, K=2: the game cannot be completed. \n\nSo, what's the difference between N=2 and N=4? \n\nIn N=2, the line through K=1 and the center is the same as the line through Alice's position (0) and the center. \n\nBut for N=2, there are only two points: 0 and 1. \n\nAlice's first move: color 0. \n\nBob's move: color 1. \n\nAll points are colored. \n\nSo, it's possible. \n\nBut for N=4, K=2, it's not possible. \n\nSo, what is the difference? \n\nIn N=2, the number of pairs is 1. \n\nFor N=4, the number of pairs is 2. \n\nSo, perhaps the condition is that when N is even and K is N/2, the game can be completed if the number of pairs is 1 (N=2). \n\nBut for N=4, it's not possible. \n\nSo, what is the general condition? \n\nIt seems that when N is even and K is N/2, the game can be completed only if N=2. \n\nBut this is not a general solution. \n\nLet me think about N=6, K=3. \n\nAlice and Bob are on the same line. \n\nAlice's first move: color 0. \n\nBob's move: color 3. \n\nNow, set is {0,3}. \n\nAlice's turn: can't move. \n\nGame ends. \n\nSo, output is No. \n\nBut for N=2, it's possible. \n\nSo, the condition for N even and K=N/2 is: \n\nIf N=2, output Yes. \n\nElse, output No. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nSo, the overall condition is: \n\nIf N is odd, output No. \n\nElse, if N=2, output Yes. \n\nElse, if K is not equal to N/2, output Yes. \n\nElse, output No. \n\nBut this would handle the N=2 case. \n\nLet's test this. \n\nFor N=2, K=1: output Yes. \n\nFor N=4, K=2: output No. \n\nFor N=6, K=3: output No. \n\nFor N=200000, K=100000: output No. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nBut what about N=2, K=0? \n\nBut according to the problem statement, K is between 1 and N-1. So, for N=2, K=1 is the only possibility. \n\nSo, this condition would work. \n\nSo, the code should check:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif N is odd: output No.\n\nelse:\n\n   if N == 2: output Yes.\n\n   else:\n\n      if K != N/2: output Yes.\n\n      else: output No.\n\nBut let's test this with N=4, K=2: output No. \n\nWith N=2, K=1: output Yes. \n\nWith N=6, K=3: output No. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nLet's check the sample input:\n\nSample 1: N=6, K=2 \u2192 even, K != 3 \u2192 Yes. \n\nSample 2: N=6, K=3 \u2192 even, K=3 \u2192 No. \n\nSample 3: N=6, K=1 \u2192 even, K != 3 \u2192 Yes. \n\nSample 4: N=200000, K=100000 \u2192 even, K=100000 \u2192 No. \n\nWhich matches the sample outputs. \n\nFor N=2, K=1: output Yes. \n\nFor N=4, K=2: output No. \n\nThis seems to handle all cases. \n\nSo, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif N is odd \u2192 print No.\n\nelse:\n\n   if N == 2 \u2192 print Yes.\n\n   else:\n\n      if K != N//2 \u2192 print Yes.\n\n      else \u2192 print No.\n\nBut wait, for N=2, K=1, it's allowed. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, this seems to be the correct condition. \n\nNow, let's implement this in Python. \n\nThe code needs to read T test cases, each with N and K. \n\nFor each case:\n\nif N is odd: print No.\n\nelse:\n\n   if N == 2: print Yes.\n\n   else:\n\n      if K != N//2: print Yes.\n\n      else: print No.\n\nBut let's check for N=2, K=1: it's allowed. \n\nYes. \n\nLet me check for N=4, K=1: even, K != 2 \u2192 output Yes. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, this should work. \n\nNow, let's write the code. \n\nRead T, then for each T lines, read N and K. \n\nFor each case:\n\nif N % 2 == 1: print 'No'\n\nelse:\n\n   if N == 2: print 'Yes'\n\n   else:\n\n      if K != N//2: print 'Yes'\n\n      else: print 'No'\n\nThis should handle all cases. \n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n6 2 \u2192 even, N != 2, K=2 != 3 \u2192 Yes\n\n6 3 \u2192 even, N != 2, K=3 == 3 \u2192 No\n\n6 1 \u2192 even, K != 3 \u2192 Yes\n\n200000 100000 \u2192 even, K=100000 == 200000/2 \u2192 No\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs. \n\nAnother test case: N=2, K=1 \u2192 Yes. \n\nN=4, K=2 \u2192 No. \n\nN=4, K=1 \u2192 Yes. \n\nThis seems to be correct. \n\nSo, this is the solution.\n</think>"

            "value": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about Alice and Bob coloring points on a circle. The circle has N equally spaced points, numbered 0 to N-1. Alice starts at point 0, Bob at point K. They take turns coloring points black, but each move must maintain symmetry with respect to the line connecting the current player to the center. The question is whether all points can be colored black in the end, given that both play optimally to maximize the total colored points.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the symmetry condition. When a player colors a point, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to the line through that player and the center. So, for example, if Alice is at point 0, then any move she makes must be such that the new black point is symmetric with respect to the line through 0 and the center. Wait, but the line connecting the operator (the player) and the center. So, for Alice's move, the line is from her position (point 0) to the center. Since the points are on a circle, the line through 0 and the center would be the line passing through 0 and the center. So the symmetry here would be reflection across that line. So, when Alice colors a point, she must choose a point that is symmetric with respect to that line. Wait, but since the line passes through 0 and the center, the reflection of any point across that line would be... Well, the line is a straight line through the center and point 0. So, for example, if the circle is divided into points, then the reflection of a point across that line would be the point that's diametrically opposite to it with respect to that line. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For example, if the circle is like a clock, and the line is through 0 (say, 12 o'clock) and the center. Then, reflecting a point across that line would be the same as the point's mirror image. For example, point 1 would be mirrored to point 5 (if N is 6). Wait, because the line through 0 and the center is the vertical line. So, for N=6, the points are at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The line through 0 and the center is the vertical line. The reflection of point 1 would be point 5, since they are symmetric across that line. Similarly, point 2 would reflect to point 4. Point 3 is on the line, so it reflects to itself.\n\nSo, when Alice makes a move, she must color a point that is symmetric with respect to her line. But since she's at point 0, the line is through 0 and the center. So, when she colors a point, the symmetry requires that the point she colors is mirrored across that line. Wait, but the problem says that after the operation, the coloring must be symmetric. So, when Alice colors a point, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to her line. So, that implies that if she colors a point x, then the symmetric point of x with respect to her line must also be colored. But since she's the first to color, she can only color one point. Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is all white. So, when Alice colors a point, she has to choose a point such that after coloring it, the entire set is symmetric. But since it's the first move, the only way to have symmetry is to color a point that is symmetric to itself. Because otherwise, if she colors x, then the symmetric point of x must also be colored. But since it's the first move, that's not possible unless x is symmetric to itself. So that implies that Alice must color a point that is symmetric to itself with respect to her line. Which would be the points on the line. For example, in the case of N=6, the line through 0 and the center would include points 0 and 3. So, Alice can only color point 0 or 3. But since the initial state is all white, she can't color point 0 (since it's already white, but maybe she can color it. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that they color a white point. So, Alice's first move must be to color a point that is symmetric with respect to her line. But since the initial state is all white, the only way to have symmetry is to color a point that is symmetric to itself. Because otherwise, if she colors x, then the symmetric point of x must also be colored. But since it's the first move, that's not possible. Therefore, Alice can only color points that are on her line of symmetry. So for her first move, she can choose to color either 0 or 3 (if N=6). But since the problem says that Alice starts at point 0, perhaps she can choose to color 0? Wait, but the problem says that the initial state is all white, so she can color point 0. But then, after that, the coloring is symmetric. Because the line of symmetry is through 0 and the center. So, the point 0 is on that line, so the coloring is symmetric. But then, when Bob takes his turn, he must color a point that is symmetric with respect to his line. But Bob is at point K. Wait, but Bob's line is determined by his position. Wait, the problem says that each operation must be symmetric with respect to the line connecting the operator (the current player) and the center. So, when Bob takes his turn, he must color a point that is symmetric with respect to his line. But Bob's line is the line through his current position (which is K) and the center. So, for example, if Bob is at K, then when he colors a point, he must choose a point that is symmetric with respect to that line. But again, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric after the operation.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. Let's think about the process. Each move must add a point such that the entire set is symmetric with respect to the line of the current player. So, for example, when Alice colors a point, she must choose a point that is symmetric with respect to her line. But since the set is initially empty, the only way to have symmetry is to color a point that is on her line. Because otherwise, the symmetric point would not be colored, which would break symmetry. Therefore, Alice's first move must be to color a point on her line. So for Alice's first move, the possible points are those that are symmetric with respect to her line. Which for her line (through 0 and the center) are the points that are on that line. For example, in N=6, the line through 0 and the center passes through points 0 and 3. So Alice can color 0 or 3. But since the initial state is all white, she can color either. But when she colors 0, then the set is symmetric. Then Bob's turn comes. Now, Bob's line is through his position (which is K) and the center. Let's take the sample input where N=6, K=2. In that case, Bob is at position 2. So his line is through 2 and the center. The line passes through 2 and the center. The symmetry here would be that any point colored by Bob must be symmetric with respect to this line. But the current set of colored points is {0} (assuming Alice colored 0). So Bob needs to color a point such that the entire set is symmetric with respect to his line. So, the current set is {0}. The line is through 2 and center. The symmetric of 0 with respect to this line would be some point. Let's think: for N=6, the line through 2 and the center. Let's imagine the circle as a clock. The line through 2 and the center would be a line that passes through point 2 (which is at 60 degrees from 0?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the symmetry for Bob's line would require that if he colors a point x, then the symmetric of x with respect to his line is also colored. But since the current set is {0}, Bob can't color any point unless the symmetric of x is already colored. But since the set is {0}, the only way for Bob to color a point is to choose a point x such that x's symmetric is already in the set. But 0's symmetric with respect to Bob's line (through 2) is some point. Let me think. For example, in N=6, the line through 2 and center. The points are arranged in a circle. The line through 2 and the center would divide the circle into two halves. The symmetric of a point x with respect to this line would be the point that is mirrored across this line. For example, point 2 is on the line, so its symmetric is itself. What about point 0? Let's imagine the line through 2 and the center. The line would pass through 2 and the center. So, for N=6, the points are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The line through 2 and center would pass through 2 and the center. So, the reflection of point 0 across this line would be point 4? Because if you imagine the line passing through 2 and the center (which is the same as the line passing through 2 and 3 (since 3 is opposite to 0?), no. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of angles. Let me think of the circle as having points at angles 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 300\u00b0, etc. For N=6. So, point 0 is at 0\u00b0, point 1 at 60\u00b0, point 2 at 120\u00b0, point 3 at 180\u00b0, point 4 at 240\u00b0, point 5 at 300\u00b0. The line through point 2 (120\u00b0) and the center is the line that goes through 120\u00b0. The reflection of a point across this line would be such that the angle between the original point and the line is the same as the angle between the reflected point and the line, but on the other side. So, for example, point 0 is at 0\u00b0, which is 120\u00b0 from the line. The reflection would be a point that's 120\u00b0 on the other side of the line. Let me calculate. The line is at 120\u00b0, so the angle between the line and the original point (0\u00b0) is 120\u00b0 - 0\u00b0 = 120\u00b0, but perhaps I should think in terms of the angle between the line and the original point. Alternatively, perhaps the reflection of point x across the line through point K and the center can be determined by some formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the symmetric point. For example, for any point x, the symmetric point with respect to the line through K and the center can be calculated. Let's think about the circle as a circle with N points. The line through K and the center divides the circle into two halves. For any point x, its symmetric point y with respect to this line is such that the line connecting x and y is perpendicular to the line through K and the center, and the midpoint of x and y lies on the line through K and the center. \n\nBut how to compute this? Well, perhaps the symmetric point of x with respect to the line through K and the center is (2*K - x) mod N. Wait, that might not be correct. Let's think for N=6, K=2. Let's take x=0. Then 2*K -x = 4, which is point 4. So the symmetric of 0 would be 4. Let's check if that makes sense. The line through K=2 and the center. The symmetric of 0 would be 4. So, if Bob is at K=2, and he colors 4, then the symmetric point would be 0. But since 0 is already colored (by Alice), that's okay. So Bob can color 4. Then the set {0,4} is symmetric with respect to the line through 2 and the center. Because 0 and 4 are symmetric. So that seems correct. \n\nSo, for a general K, the symmetric of x with respect to the line through K and the center is (2*K - x) mod N. Wait, but maybe there's a better way to think about it. Let's think of the line through K and the center as the line that passes through K and the center. For any point x, the symmetric point y would be such that K is the midpoint between x and y. Because if you reflect x over the line through K and the center, then the line through K and the center is the axis of symmetry. So, the midpoint of x and y is on the axis. So, the midpoint between x and y is K. Therefore, K = (x + y) / 2 mod N. Wait, but since we are dealing with modular arithmetic, perhaps we can write y = 2*K -x mod N. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So for any x, the symmetric point y is (2*K -x) mod N. So, for example, when K is 2 and x is 0, y is 4, which is correct. \n\nSo, when a player colors a point x, the symmetric point y must also be colored. But since the player is coloring x, they must have already colored y, or else the symmetry would not be maintained. Wait, but the problem says that after the operation, the coloring must be symmetric. So, when a player colors x, the entire set must be symmetric. So, if x is colored, then the symmetric point y must also be colored. But since the player is coloring x, that implies that y is not yet colored. Therefore, the only way for the coloring to be symmetric is that x is symmetric to itself. Which would mean that x is on the axis of symmetry. Because if x is not on the axis, then its symmetric point y would be different from x, and since y is not yet colored, the set would not be symmetric. \n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me think again. Suppose the player is at K. When they color a point x, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to the line through K and the center. So, if x is colored, then y (its symmetric point) must also be colored. But since the player is coloring x, and y is not yet colored, this would not be possible. Therefore, the only way for the player to color x is that x is symmetric to itself. Which implies that x is on the axis of symmetry. Because if x is on the axis, then its symmetric point is itself. So, in that case, coloring x would make the set symmetric. \n\nWait, but that would mean that each move must color a point on the axis of symmetry of the current player. So, for example, when Alice starts, she is at position 0. The axis is through 0 and the center. So, she can only color points that are on that axis. Which are points 0 and (N/2) if N is even. For example, in N=6, the axis passes through 0 and 3. So, Alice can color 0 or 3. \n\nSo, when Alice colors a point, she must choose a point on her axis. Then, when Bob takes his turn, he is at position K. His axis is through K and the center. So, he must color a point on that axis. \n\nBut this seems to imply that each move must color a point on the axis of the current player. So, the players are alternately choosing points on their respective axes. \n\nBut how does this affect the overall process? Let's think about the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1: N=6, K=2. \n\nSample Output is Yes. \n\nIn the explanation, Alice colors 3 first. Wait, but according to the previous reasoning, Alice's axis is through 0 and 3. So, she can color 0 or 3. So, coloring 3 is allowed. Then, Bob's axis is through K=2 and the center. The axis would pass through 2 and 3 (since N=6, the opposite of 2 is 2 + 3 = 5? Wait, perhaps the axis for K=2 is through 2 and the center. The symmetric points on that axis would be 2 and (2*2 - 2) mod 6 = 2. So, the axis includes 2 and the center. Wait, but for N=6, the axis through K=2 and the center would pass through 2 and 3 (since 3 is the opposite of 0). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nBut according to the earlier formula, the symmetric point of x with respect to the axis of K is (2*K -x) mod N. So, for K=2, the symmetric of 2 is (4 - 2) mod 6 = 2. So, 2 is on the axis. So, the axis includes all points that are symmetric to themselves with respect to K's axis. Which would be points x where x = (2*K -x) mod N \u2192 2x \u2261 2K mod N \u2192 x \u2261 K mod N/2. So, perhaps the axis of symmetry for K is the line that passes through K and the center. So, the points on that axis are those that are symmetric to themselves. For example, K is on the axis. Also, the point opposite to K (if N is even) would be on the axis. \n\nBut regardless, each move must color a point that is on the axis of the current player. \n\nSo, for Alice's first move, she can choose any point on her axis (0 and 3 for N=6). Let's say she chooses 3. Then, the set is {3}. Now, Bob's turn. His axis is through K=2. He can choose any point on his axis. The points on his axis would be those that are symmetric to themselves with respect to the axis through K=2. For example, the symmetric of x with respect to K's axis is (2K -x) mod N. So, for x to be on the axis, x must equal (2K -x) mod N \u2192 2x \u2261 2K mod N \u2192 x \u2261 K mod (N/2). \n\nBut for N=6 and K=2, 2x \u2261 4 mod 6 \u2192 x \u2261 2 mod 3. So x can be 2 or 5 (since 2+3=5). Wait, 5 mod 3 is 2. So, the points on the axis are 2 and 5? Or perhaps I'm getting the math wrong. Let me compute for N=6, K=2. \n\nThe axis is through K=2 and the center. So, the points on this axis are those that are symmetric to themselves. So, for x to be on the axis, (2K -x) mod N = x. \n\nSo 2K -x \u2261 x mod N \u2192 2K \u2261 2x mod N \u2192 K \u2261 x mod N/2. \n\nSo for N=6, K=2, x must be congruent to 2 mod 3. So possible x values are 2 and 5 (since 2 mod 3 is 2, 5 mod 3 is 2). So the points on Bob's axis are 2 and 5. \n\nSo Bob can choose to color either 2 or 5. Let's say he chooses 2. Then the set is {3, 2}. Now, the next move is Alice's. Her axis is through 0 and 3. She can choose points on that axis. The points on that axis are 0 and 3. But 3 is already colored. So she can choose 0. Then the set is {0, 2, 3}. Then Bob's turn. His axis is through 2. He can choose points on his axis (2 and 5). 2 is already colored. So he can choose 5. Then the set is {0, 2, 3, 5}. Then Alice's turn. Her axis is 0 and 3. She can choose points on that axis. 0 and 3 are already colored. So she can't choose any. Wait, but then the next move would be Bob's. But he has to choose a point on his axis. The points on his axis are 2 and 5. Both are already colored. So he can't move. So the total colored points are 4, which is less than 6. But the sample says that for N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. Because the sample input for N=6 and K=2 is possible to color all points. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the symmetry condition. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says that after the operation, the coloring must be symmetric with respect to the line connecting the operator and the center. \n\nSo, when a player colors a point, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to that line. \n\nSo, for example, when Alice colors a point x, then the entire set must be symmetric with respect to her line. So, the set must include the symmetric of x. But since it's the first move, the only way this is possible is if x is symmetric to itself. Because otherwise, the symmetric point is not colored. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that each move must color a point that is symmetric to itself with respect to the current player's line. Which means that the point is on the line. \n\nBut then, when Alice colors a point on her line, the set becomes symmetric. Then, when Bob colors a point on his line, the set must be symmetric with respect to his line. \n\nBut the set may not be symmetric with respect to both lines. Wait, but the problem says that the operation must be symmetric with respect to the current player's line. So, each move must satisfy the symmetry condition for the current player's line. \n\nSo, for example, after Alice colors point 3 (on her line), the set {3} is symmetric with respect to her line. Then, Bob's move must make the set symmetric with respect to his line. So, Bob can color a point that is symmetric to itself with respect to his line. \n\nBut if Bob colors a point that is symmetric to itself, then the set {3, x} must be symmetric with respect to his line. But how can that be? For example, if Bob colors point 2 (which is on his line), then the set {3, 2} must be symmetric with respect to his line. \n\nBut the line through Bob's position (2) and the center. So, the set {3, 2} must be symmetric with respect to that line. \n\nBut the line through 2 and the center. For the set {2,3}, the symmetry would require that each point has its symmetric counterpart. So, for point 2, it's on the line, so it's symmetric. For point 3, its symmetric point with respect to Bob's line is (2*2 -3) mod 6 = (4-3) mod 6 = 1. But 1 is not colored. So the set {2,3} is not symmetric with respect to Bob's line. Therefore, Bob cannot color 3. \n\nWait, this is a problem. So, Bob's move must color a point x such that the entire set of colored points is symmetric with respect to his line. So, when Bob colors a point x, the symmetric of x with respect to his line must already be in the set. Or, x must be symmetric to itself. \n\nSo, if Bob colors x, then the symmetric of x must be already in the set, or x is on the line. \n\nWait, but the set before Bob's move is {3}. So, when Bob colors x, the new set is {3, x}. For this new set to be symmetric with respect to Bob's line, the symmetric of x must be in the set. \n\nSo, for example, if Bob colors x=1, then the symmetric of x with respect to his line is (2*2 -1) mod 6 = 3. Which is already in the set. So, the new set {3, 1} is symmetric with respect to Bob's line. Because for each point, its symmetric is present. \n\nAh! So, Bob can color x=1. Because then, the symmetric of x is 3, which is already in the set. \n\nSo, this changes the earlier reasoning. \n\nSo, the key insight is that when a player colors a point x, the entire set of colored points must be symmetric with respect to the current player's line. Therefore, the set must include the symmetric of x. But since the player is adding x, the symmetric of x must already be in the set. Or, x is symmetric to itself (so, on the line). \n\nWait, but in the case where the player adds x, and the symmetric of x is not in the set. Then, the set would not be symmetric. So, the only way for the set to be symmetric is that the symmetric of x is already in the set. \n\nBut that would mean that the player can only color points x for which their symmetric is already in the set. \n\nBut then, how can the first move be made? \n\nFor Alice's first move, the set is empty. She needs to color x such that the set {x} is symmetric with respect to her line. That requires that the symmetric of x is already in the set. But since the set is empty, the only possibility is that x's symmetric is x itself. Which implies that x is on the line. \n\nSo, Alice can only color points that are on her line. \n\nSo, for example, in the first move, Alice can choose to color 0 or 3 (for N=6). \n\nThen, after that, Bob's move. Let's say Alice colored 3. Now, Bob's line is through K=2. He can\n\nI received a request from the user to provide an answer right now.

So, the points not on Alice's axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. The points not on Bob's axis are 0, 2, 3, 5. The intersection of these is 2 and 5. Which is even. So, why is the answer Yes?\n        # Let's think of the process. Alice starts by coloring 3 (on her axis). Bob can color 1 (on his axis). Then Alice can color 5 (symmetric to 1 with respect to her axis? Or symmetric to 5 with respect to her axis. Let's see: For Alice's axis (through 0 and 3), the symmetric of 5 is (2*0 -5) mod 6 = 1. So, if Alice colors 5, the symmetric is 1, which is already colored. So, she can. Then Bob can color 2 (symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -2) mod 6 = 0. Which is not colored. Wait, no. Bob's axis is through 1. So, the symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 - 2) mod 6 = 0. So, if Bob colors 2, then the symmetric is 0, which is not colored. So, he can't. So, this seems to be a problem. How does the sample input for N=6, K=1 have a Yes answer?\n        # Perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think of the sample input for N=6, K=1. The sample output is Yes. According to the explanation, it's possible to color all points. Let's think of the steps:\n        # Alice's first move: color 3 (on her axis). Now, the set is {3}.\n        # Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color a point on his axis, which is 1. So, he colors 1. Now, the set is {3, 1}.\n        # Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric of 1 with respect to her axis is 1, which is already there. Wait, no. The symmetric of 1 with respect to Alice's axis is (2*0 -1) mod 6 = 5. So, if Alice colors 5, then the symmetric is 1, which is already in the set. So, she can do that. Now the set is {3,1,5}.\n        # Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color a point on his axis. The points on his axis are 1 and (2*1 -1) mod 6 = 1. So, he can only color 1, which is already colored. So, he can't. So, the game ends with 3 points colored. But the sample says it's Yes. So, this suggests that there's another way to proceed.\n        # Let's think again. Maybe Alice's first move is to color 0. Then the set is {0}. Bob's turn. His axis is through 1. He can choose to color 1 (on his axis). Now the set is {0,1}. Alice's turn. She can choose to color 3 (on her axis). Now the set is {0,1,3}. Bob's turn. He can choose to color 2 (symmetric of 2 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -2) mod 6 = 0. Which is already in the set. So, he can color 2. Now the set is {0,1,3,2}. Alice's turn. She can color 5 (symmetric of 1 is 5, which is already in the set). So, she colors 5. Now the set is {0,1,3,2,5}. Bob's turn. He can color 4 (symmetric of 4 with respect to his axis is (2*1 -4) mod 6 = (2-4) mod 6 = 4. So, 4 is on his axis. So, he can color 4. Now all points are colored. So, this works.\n        # So, the key is that the players can choose to color points on their axis, and the symmetric of those points may be already colored.

For K=3, it's No. For K=1, it's Yes. For K=100000, it's No.\n        # Let's think about the parity of K. For N=6, K=2 is even, K=3 is odd, K=1 is odd. The answer for K=2 is Yes, for K=3 is No, for K=1 is Yes.\n        # For N=200000, K=100000 is N/2. The answer is No.\n        # So, perhaps the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. But for N=6, K=3 is N/2, and the answer is No. For N=6, K=2 is not N/2, and the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1 is not N/2, and the answer is Yes. For N=200000, K=100000 is N/2, and the answer is No. So this seems to fit.\n        # What about other cases? For example, N=4, K=1. Let's see:\n        # N=4, K=1. Alice's axis is through 0 and 2. Bob's axis is through 1 and 3. The points not on either axis are none. So, all points are on the axes. So, the players can alternate making moves. Let's see:\n        # Alice colors 0. Bob colors 1. Alice colors 2. Bob colors 3. All points are colored. So, the answer is Yes.\n        # For N=4, K=2 (N/2), the answer is No. Because Alice colors 0, Bob can only color 2 (which is already on his axis). But then he can't move. So, the answer is No.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is that K is not equal to N/2. But wait, for N=6, K=3 is N/2 and the answer is No. For N=4, K=2 is N/2 and the answer is No. But for N=6, K=1 is not N/2 and the answer is Yes. So, this seems to fit.\n        # What about N=6, K=2? K is not N/2. The answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, answer is No. For N=6, K=4 (which is N/2 + 2), the answer would be Yes? Let's see. N=6, K=4. Bob is at 4. His axis is through 4 and the center. The axis includes 4 and (2*4 -4) mod 6 = 4. So, the axis includes 4. Alice's axis is 0 and 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Wait, 5 is not on either axis. Let's see: For Alice's axis, 0 and 3. For Bob's axis, 4. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Which is odd. So, the answer would be No. But according to the previous pattern, K=4 is not N/2, so the answer should be Yes. This contradicts the pattern.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is not simply whether K is equal to N/2.\n        # Let's think of another pattern. The sample inputs suggest that when K is equal to N/2, the answer is No. Otherwise, it's Yes. But this is not the case for N=6, K=1, which is not N/2 and the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=2, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3 (N/2), answer is No. For N=6, K=4 (which is N/2 + 2), the answer would be Yes or No?\n        # Let's think about N=6, K=4. Bob is at 4. His axis is through 4 and the center. So, the points on his axis are 4 and (2*4 -4) mod 6 = 4. So, only 4. Alice's axis is 0 and 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 5. Which is odd. So, it's impossible to pair them. So, the answer would be No. But according to the previous pattern, since K is not N/2, the answer is Yes. This contradicts the pattern. So, the pattern is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that the condition is more complex. Perhaps the correct condition is that the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can alternate making moves.\n        # But how to calculate this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of Alice or Bob is even. But how to calculate this?\n        # For Alice's axis, the number of points on it is 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. For Bob's axis, it's 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. But this depends on K.\n        # For example, if N is even, and K is not N/2, then Bob's axis has 2 points. So, the points on Alice's axis are 2, and on Bob's axis are 2. The intersection is 0 if K is not N/2. So, the total number of points on either axis is 2 + 2 - 0 = 4. The total number of points not on either axis is N - 4. For N=6, this is 6-4=2, which is even. So, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3 (N/2), the points on Alice's axis are 2, and on Bob's axis are 1 (since K is N/2, the axis has only 1 point). So, the total number of points on either axis is 2 + 1 - 1 = 2. The number of points not on either axis is 6-2=4, which is even. But the sample input for N=6, K=3 is No. So, this suggests that the condition is not sufficient.\n        # This is getting too complex. Perhaps the solution is to check if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions allow for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # But I'm stuck. Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions allow for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the number of points not on either axis is 4 (even), but the answer is No. So, this condition is not sufficient. What's different in this case?\n        # In this case, Alice's axis includes 0 and 3, and Bob's axis includes 3. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 2, 4, 5. But how can the players color these points?\n        # Let's try to simulate. Alice colors 0 (on her axis). Bob can color 3 (on his axis). Now, the set is {0, 3}. Alice's turn. She can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, no move. The game ends. So, the answer is No.\n        # So, the problem is that the initial moves by the players may not allow for all points to be colored, even if the number of points not on the axes is even.\n        # This suggests that the condition is not just about the number of points not on the axes, but also about the initial positions allowing for the players to alternate making moves.\n        # Perhaps the correct condition is that the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can make moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the initial positions are such that the players can take turns making moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. This allows for the players to pair them up. But the players must be able to alternate making moves. This depends on the initial positions.\n        # For example, if the initial positions are such that the players can make moves, then it's possible.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The game can end with all points colored if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even and the initial positions are not on the same axis.\n        # For N=6, K=3, the initial positions are on the same axis (3 is on both Alice's and Bob's axis). So, the answer is No. For N=6, K=2, the initial positions are not on the same axis. So, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, the initial positions are not on the same axis. So, the answer is Yes. For N=200000, K=100000 (N/2), the initial positions are on the same axis. So, the answer is No.\n        # This seems to fit the sample inputs. Let's test this hypothesis.\n        # For N=6, K=3: initial positions are on the same axis (3). So, answer is No.\n        # For N=6, K=2: initial positions are not on the same axis. So, answer is Yes.\n        # For N=6, K=1: initial positions are not on the same axis. So, answer is Yes.\n        # For N=200000, K=100000: initial positions are on the same axis.

Answer is No.\n        # N=4, K=3: initial positions are not on the same axis. Answer is Yes.\n        # So, this hypothesis seems to fit. The condition is that the initial positions are not on the same axis. How to determine this?\n        # The initial positions are on the same axis if and only if K is on Alice's axis. Alice's axis is through 0 and the center. The points on this axis are 0 and N/2 if N is even. So, for K to be on Alice's axis, K must be 0 or N/2. But K is between 1 and N-1, so K can be N/2. So, for K to be on Alice's axis, it must be N/2.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, then the initial positions are on the same axis, and the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2), the answer is No. For N=6, K=2, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=1, the answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, it's No.\n        # But what about N=4, K=2 (N/2), the answer is No. For N=4, K=1, the answer is Yes.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, then the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But this seems to fit the sample inputs. Let's check the sample input for N=6, K=1. K is not N/2, so answer is Yes. For N=6, K=2, answer is Yes. For N=6, K=3, answer is No. For N=200000, K=100000 (N/2), answer is No. So, this seems to fit.\n        # But what about N=4, K=2 (N/2), answer is No. For N=4, K=1, answer is Yes. For N=4, K=3, answer is Yes.\n        # Let's test another case: N=8, K=4 (N/2). Answer is No. For N=8, K=2, answer is Yes.\n        # This seems to fit. So, the condition is: the answer is Yes if and only if K is not equal to N/2.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2) \u2192 No. N=6, K=1 \u2192 Yes. N=6, K=2 \u2192 Yes. N=6, K=3 \u2192 No. This fits.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3, which is N/2. The answer is No. But what if N is even and K is not N/2? The answer is Yes.\n        # So, the solution is to check if K is equal to N/2. If it is, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3 (N/2), and the players can make moves? Let's think. For example, Alice colors 0. Bob colors 3. Now, the set is {0,3}. Alice's turn. She can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). So, no move. Hence, the answer is No.\n        # So, the condition is that if K is equal to N/2, then the answer is No. Otherwise, the answer is Yes.\n        # But what about N=4, K=1. N/2 is 2.

Answer is No. Correct.\n        # So, this seems to be the correct condition. But why?\n        # Because when K is equal to N/2, Alice and Bob are on the same axis. Alice starts, and she can color a point on the axis. Bob can color the same point (which is already colored). So, he cannot make a move. Hence, the game ends early.\n        # So, the solution is to check if K is equal to N/2. If yes, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3. N is even, K is N/2. Output No.\n        # What about N=4, K=2. Output No.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3. What if Alice colors 3 first? Then Bob can color 3 again? No, it's already colored. So, no move. Hence, answer is No.\n        # So, the condition is: if K is equal to N/2, output No. Else, output Yes.\n        # But wait, what about N=6, K=3. N is even, K is N/2. Output No.\n        # But what about N=6, K=3. Let's think of another scenario. Alice colors 0. Bob colors 3. Then, Alice can color 3 (already colored) or 0 (already colored). No move. So, answer is No.\n        # So, this condition seems to be correct.\n        # Now, let's check the sample input for N=6, K=1. K is not N/2. Output is Yes. Correct.\n        # So, the code can be written as follows: For each test case, if N is even and K is equal to N/2, output No. Otherwise, output Yes.\n        # Wait, but what about when N is odd? For example, N=5, K=2. N is odd. N/2 is 2.5. So, K cannot be N/2. So, the answer is Yes.\n        # For N=5, K=2. Alice's axis is through 0 and the center (but since N is odd, there is no point opposite to 0. So, the axis for Alice is only 0. Bob's axis is through K=2 and the center. So, the points on Bob's axis are 2 and (2*2 -2) mod 5 = 2. So, only 2. So, the points not on either axis are 1, 3, 4. Which is odd. So, the answer would be No. But according to the condition, since K is not N/2 (N=5, N/2 is 2.5), the answer is Yes. This contradicts.\n        # So, this suggests that the condition is not correct.\n        # For N=5, K=2. According to the previous condition, since K is not equal to N/2 (which is not an integer), the answer is Yes. But according to the simulation, it might not be possible.\n        # Let's simulate N=5, K=2. Alice starts at 0, Bob at 2.\n        # Alice's axis is through 0 and the center. For N=5, the axis includes 0 and the center. But since N is odd, there is no point opposite to 0. So, the axis for Alice includes only 0.\n        # Bob's axis is through 2 and the center. So, the points on his axis are 2 and (2*2 - 2) mod 5 = 2. So, only 2.\n        # So, the points not on either axis are 1, 3, 4. Which is 3 points, odd. So, it's impossible to pair them. Hence, the answer should be No.\n        # But according to the previous condition, since K is not N/2, the answer is Yes. This is a contradiction.\n        # So, the previous condition is incorrect.\n        # This suggests that the condition is more complex. It seems that the condition is not simply whether K is equal to N/2.\n        # At this point, I'm stuck and need to find another approach.\n        # Let's think about the problem from a different angle. The game is a variant of the game where each move colors a point and its symmetric. The players alternate, and the goal is to maximize the number of colored points. The question is whether all points can be colored.\n        # For all points to be colored, the number of points must be even? Or odd?\n        # Let's think: For all points to be colored, the total number of moves must be N. Since each move adds exactly one point, the number of moves is N. Since the players alternate, if N is even, each player makes N/2 moves. If N is odd, one player makes (N+1)/2 moves and the other makes (N-1)/2.\n        # But how does this relate to the initial positions?\n        # The key is whether the players can make all moves. For this, the players must be able to choose points on their axes, and the symmetric of those points must be already colored.\n        # Let's think about the following: For all points to be colored, the initial positions must allow for the players to alternate making moves until all points are colored. This is possible if and only if the number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even, and the players can alternate making moves.\n        # But how to determine this?\n        # Let's think of the following: The number of points that are not on the axis of either player is even. For example, in N=6, K=2, this number is 4 (even). In N=5, K=2, this number is 3 (odd), so it's impossible.\n        # So, the condition is that the number of points not on the axis of either player is even.\n        # Let's calculate this number. The number of points on Alice's axis is 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. For Bob's axis, it's 1 if N is odd, or 2 if N is even. The intersection of these two axes is 1 if K is on Alice's axis, or 0 otherwise.\n        # So, the number of points on either axis is:\n        # For N even:\n        # Alice's axis has 2 points.\n        # Bob's axis has 2 points.\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (i.e., K is 0 or N/2), then the intersection is 1 point. So, total points on either axis is 2 + 2 - 1 = 3.\n        # Otherwise, the intersection is 0, so total is 2 + 2 = 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # Alice's axis has 1 point.\n        # Bob's axis has 1 point.\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (which is only possible if K=0, but K is between 1 and N-1), so it's not possible. So, the intersection is 0. Total is 1 + 1 = 2.\n        # So, the number of points not on either axis is N - (number on either axis).\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K=0 or N/2), then number of points on either axis is 3. So, N - 3.\n        # If K is not on Alice's axis, then number of points on either axis is 4. So, N - 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # Number of points on either axis is 2. So, N - 2.\n        # So, the number of points not on either axis is:\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis: N - 3.\n        # Else: N - 4.\n        # For N odd: N - 2.\n        # For all points to be colored, this number must be even.\n        # Let's check this with the sample inputs.\n        # Sample input 1: N=6 (even), K=2 (not on Alice's axis). N-4 = 6-4=2 (even). So, answer is Yes.\n        # Sample input 2: N=6, K=3 (on Alice's axis). N-3=6-3=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # Sample input 3: N=6, K=1 (not on Alice's axis). N-4=2 (even). Answer is Yes.\n        # Sample input 4: N=200000 (even), K=100000 (on Alice's axis). N-3=200000-3=199997 (odd). Answer is No.\n        # For N=5 (odd), K=2. N-2=5-2=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # This fits with the previous example. So, the condition is that the number of points not on either axis is even.\n        # So, the steps to determine the answer are:\n        # 1. For each test case, calculate the number of points not on either axis.\n        # 2. If this number is even, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n        # Now, how to calculate this number.\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K is 0 or N/2), then the number of points not on either axis is N - 3.\n        # Else, it's N - 4.\n        # For N odd:\n        # The number of points not on either axis is N - 2.\n        # So, for N odd, the number is N-2. For this to be even, N-2 must be even \u2192 N must be even. But N is odd, so N-2 is odd. So, for N odd, the number of points not on either axis is odd, so the answer is No.\n        # Wait, this suggests that for N odd, the answer is always No. But this contradicts the earlier example where N=5, K=2. Let's see:\n        # For N=5 (odd), the number of points not on either axis is 5-2=3 (odd). So, answer is No.\n        # But what about N=5, K=2. Can the players color all points?\n        # Let's try to simulate:\n        # Alice starts at 0. She can color 0 (on her axis). Bob's axis is through 2. He can color 2. Now, the set is {0, 2}. Alice's turn. She can color points on her axis (0 is already colored). So, no move. The game ends. So, answer is No. So, the condition is correct.\n        # So, for N odd, the number of points not on either axis is N-2, which is odd. So, the answer is No.\n        # For N even:\n        # If K is on Alice's axis (K=0 or N/2), then the number of points not on either axis is N-3. This must be even.\n        # So, N-3 must be even \u2192 N must be odd. But N is even, so N-3 is odd. So, for N even and K on Alice's axis, the number is odd. So, answer is No.\n        # Else, for N even and K not on Alice's axis, the number is N-4. This must be even \u2192 N-4 must be even \u2192 N must be even. So, for N even and K not on Alice's axis, the number is even. So, answer is Yes.\n        # So, the overall conditions are:\n        # - If N is odd: answer is No.\n        # - If N is even:\n        #   - If K is equal to N/2 or 0 (but K is between 1 and N-1, so K=0 is not possible), then answer is No.\n        #   - Else, answer is Yes.\n        # But wait, for N even, K is between 1 and N-1.

            "value": "The problem:\n\nGame: Nim-like with moves {1,4}. Alice starts. The player who removes last token wins. This is typical impartial combinatorial game, take-away game. Determine for which starting sizes n up to 2024 does Bob have a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play. Equivalent: Determine all n for which the first player (Alice) is in a losing position (so Bob has a winning strategy). So we need positions that are P-positions (previous player wins) i.e., losing for the player about to move. Since Alice is first, Bob will win exactly when n is a P-position (since Bob as second player will win). So find all positive integers n <= 2024 that are P-positions given moves {1,4}.\n\nLet's analyze the take-away game.\n\nDefine: P-positions: positions where the previous player (the one who just moved) wins, i.e., the next player to move (current) loses with optimal play.\n\nIn take-away games with moves set {1,4}, the P-positions are defined by recursion: a position n is P if none of the positions reachable in one move (i.e., n-1 or n-4 if non-negative) is P (i.e., all reachable positions are N, meaning winning for the player to move). Actually, more formally: n is a P-position if all moves from n lead to N-positions (i.e., winning for the player who has to move next). And n is N if there is at least one move to a P-position.\n\nSo compute P-positions recursively.\n\nWe can attempt to find a pattern.\n\nThe base: 0 tokens: previous player (who removed last token) wins. But our game start positions positive n. But we can use n=0 as P-position by convention, because if there are 0 tokens on your turn, you lose (the previous player removed last). So define n=0 as terminal position where the player to move loses, so it's a P-position. So indeed, n=0 is P (losing for next player). Then we compute upward.\n\nLet move set M = {1,4}.\n\nCompute positions:\n\n- n=0: P\n- n=1: Can remove 1 -> n=0 (P). So there is a move to a P position, so n=1 is N (winning for player).\n- n=2: Moves: remove 1 -> n=1 (N). remove 4 not possible. All reachable positions (only n=1) are N. So cannot force P, so n=2 is P.\n- n=3: Moves: remove 1 -> n=2 (P). So there is a winning move, so n=3 is N.\n- n=4: Moves: remove 1 -> n=3 (N). remove 4 -> n=0 (P). There exists a move to P (n=0). So n=4 is N.\n- n=5: Moves: remove 1 -> n=4 (N), remove 4 -> n=1 (N). All reachable N, so n=5 is P.\n- n=6: Moves: remove 1 -> n=5 (P) -> winning, so n=6 is N.\n- n=7: 1->6(N), 4->3(N). All reachable N, so n=7 is P.\n- n=8: 1->7(P). So n=8 N.\n- n=9: 1->8(N), 4->5(P). There is move to P. So n=9 N. Wait we need to check: 9-1=8 (N). 9-4=5 (P). So there is a move to P, so N.\n- n=10: 1->9(N). 4->6(N). All reachable N, so P.\n- n=11: 1->10(P) -> N.\n- n=12: 1->11(N), 4->8(N). All N, so P.\n- n=13: 1->12(P) -> N.\n- n=14: 1->13(N), 4->10(P). => N (since a move to P).\n- n=15: 1->14(N), 4->11(N). => P.\n- n=16: 1->15(P) => N.\n- n=17: 1->16(N), 4->13(N) => P.\n- n=18: 1->17(P) => N.\n- n=19: 1->18(N), 4->15(P) => N. Actually check: 19-1=18 (N), 19-4=15(P). So there is a winning move to 15 P; thus 19 N.\n- n=20: 1->19(N), 4->16(N) => P.\n- n=21: 1->20(P)=>N.\n- n=22: 1->21(N), 4->18(N) => P.\n- n=23: 1->22(P)=>N.\n- n=24: 1->23(N), 4->20(P) => N.\n- n=25: 1->24(N), 4->21(N) => P.\n- n=26: 1->25(P)=>N.\n- n=27: 1->26(N), 4->23(N)=>P.\n- n=28: 1->27(P)=>N.\n- n=29: 1->28(N), 4->25(P)=>N.\n- n=30: 1->29(N), 4->26(N)=>P.\n- n=31: 1->30(P)=>N.\n- n=32: 1->31(N), 4->28(N)=>P.\n- n=33: 1->32(P)=>N.\n- n=34: 1->33(N), 4->30(P)=>N.\n- n=35: 1->34(N), 4->31(N)=>P.\n- n=36: 1->35(P)=>N.\n- n=37: 1->36(N), 4->33(N)=>P.\n- n=38: 1->37(P)=>N.\n\nSeems pattern emerges: P-positions are maybe those congruent to 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15,... It's not obviously simple modulo something.\n\nBetter to compute and find recurrence or periodicity. Since moves are {1,4}, with maximum removal 4. For impartial take-away games with finite move set, the Sprague-Grundy sequence is eventually periodic with period at most something. For Nim-heap size n with 1,4, the P-positions will eventually be periodic with period equal to least common multiple of something? Actually for subtraction games with subtraction set S, the sequence of P-positions is known to be ultimately periodic with period dividing some function of S, often 2^k?? Actually the subtraction game with S {1,4} maybe has period of length 5? Let's test.\n\nLet's compute more values.\n\nWe have already computed up to n=38 maybe. We can compute further up to maybe > 42 to detect repeating pattern.\n\nLet's list P-positions found up to 38:\n\nIndices n and classification:\n\n0 P\n1 N\n2 P\n3 N\n4 N\n5 P\n6 N\n7 P\n8 N\n9 N\n10 P\n11 N\n12 P\n13 N\n14 N\n15 P\n16 N\n17 P\n18 N\n19 N\n20 P\n21 N\n22 P\n23 N\n24 N\n25 P\n26 N\n27 P\n28 N\n29 N\n30 P\n31 N\n32 P\n33 N\n34 N\n35 P\n36 N\n37 P\n38 N\n39... compute.\n\nNow we can derive pattern: The sequence of P-positions seems to follow a rule: After each group, there's a pattern of length maybe 5? Let's check consecutive P positions differences:\n\nDifferences between consecutive P positions: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2, 15-12=3, 17-15=2, 20-17=3, 22-20=2, 25-22=3, 27-25=2, 30-27=3, 32-30=2, 35-32=3, 37-35=2, 40-37=3? Wait 40? Let's compute n=39 and n=40 to confirm.\n\nLet's compute n=39:\n\nn=39: 1->38(N), 4->35(P) => N (move to P). So 39 N.\n\nn=40: 1->39(N), 4->36(N) => P. So 40 P. So difference 40-37=3. Good.\n\nNow differences continue: pattern 2,3,2,3,... repeating? Let's continue further.\n\nn=41: 1->40(P) => N.\n\nn=42: 1->41(N), 4->38(N) => P. So 42 P? Wait check: 42-1=41 (N), 42-4=38 (N). So all reachable are N -> P indeed. So 42 P. The difference 42-40=2. pattern 2,3,2,3,... continues.\n\nn=43: 1->42(P) -> N\n\nn=44: 1->43(N), 4->40(P) -> N. So 44 N.\n\nn=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N) -> P? Wait 45-1=44 (N), 45-4=41 (N). So all reachable N, thus 45 P. Diff 45-42=3.\n\nn=46: 1->45(P) -> N.\n\nn=47: 1->46(N), 4->43(N) -> P? 47-4=43 (N). So 47 reachable N; 47-1=46 (N). All reachable N -> 47 P. Diff 47-45=2.\n\nn=48: 1->47(P) -> N.\n\nn=49: 1->48(N), 4->45(P) -> N. So 49 N.\n\nn=50: 1->49(N), 4->46(N) -> P. Diff 50-47=3? Wait 50-47=3 actually 50-47=3. Wait 47 is P. We said 47 P. 50-47=3. But 50 P indeed. So pattern holds.\n\nn=51: 1->50(P) => N.\n\nn=52: 1->51(N), 4->48(N) -> P (diff 52-50=2).\n\nn=53: 1->52(P) => N.\n\nn=54: 1->53(N), 4->50(P) => N. So 54 N.\n\nn=55: 1->54(N), 4->51(N) -> P. Diff 55-52=3.\n\nn=56: 1->55(P) -> N.\n\nn=57: 1->56(N), 4->53(N) -> P? Wait 57-4=53 (N). So 57 P. Diff 57-55=2.\n\nn=58: 1->57(P) -> N.\n\nn=59: 1->58(N), 4->55(P) => N. So 59 N.\n\nn=60: 1->59(N), 4->56(N) => P. Diff 60-57=3.\n\nWe see a repeating pattern: P positions come in groups separated by pattern [2,3] repeated? Let's confirm from start:\n\nStarting from n=0 P.\n\nP positions list for first few:\n\n0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,32,35,37,40,42,45,47,50,52,55,57,60,...\n\nLet's check the difference pattern:\n\n0->2: 2\n2->5: 3\n5->7: 2\n7->10:3\n10->12:2\n12->15:3\n15->17:2\n17->20:3\n20->22:2\n22->25:3\n25->27:2\n27->30:3\n30->32:2\n32->35:3\n35->37:2\n37->40:3\n40->42:2\n42->45:3\n45->47:2\n47->50:3\n50->52:2\n52->55:3\n55->57:2\n57->60:3\n\nSo indeed pattern [2,3] repeated, starting from 0. So P-positions for the subtraction set {1,4} follow the pattern 0,2,5,7,10,... with differences alternating 2,3,...\n\nThus P positions are numbers that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Let's think: sequence maybe all numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let's test a few numbers: 0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,... Are all of those P? Let's check 5 is P (yes). 10 P, 15 P, 20 P, etc. 30 P, 35 P, 40 P, 45 P. Check 25 P? yes. 50 P. So all numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 appear to be P.\n\nNow numbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57,... All are P as per list.\n\nNumbers congruent to 1 mod5: 1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56,... Not P? Let's check: 1 N, 6 N, 11 N, 16 N, 21 N, 26 N, 31 N, 36 N, 41 N, 46 N, 51 N, 56 N. So indeed 1 mod 5 are N.\n\nNumbers congruent to 3 mod5: 3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58,... N? Let's check: 3 N, 8 N? Wait 8 is N. 13 N? 13 N. 18 N. 23 N. 28 N. 33 N. 38 N. 43 N. 48 N. 53 N. 58 N. Are these all N? Check 48: above we had 48 N? Actually we earlier found 48: n=48 we determined 48? Wait we had 48? Let's check 48 earlier: n=48 (from sequence above) I think 48 N. I recall 48 was \"N\"? Let's double-check.\n\nAt n=48: Moves: 48-1=47 (P). Wait 47 P. So 48 has a move to a P- position, thus 48 is N. Yes, 48 N. 53: n=53 we found a move? Let's compute: 53-1=52 (P) so 53 N. 58: 58-1=57(P) -> 58 N. So yes 3 mod5 are N.\n\nNumbers congruent to 4 mod5: 4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49,54,59,... Should be N? Let's check: 4 N? Wait earlier we had 4 N. 9 N? We found 9 N. 14 N? We found 14 N. 19 N? We found 19 N. 24 N? We found 24?? Let's check: 24 we found earlier as N? Wait above we had 24 N? I recall 24 N? Let's check: 24: 1->23(N) 4->20(P) so 24 N. So 24 N indeed. 29 N? We had 29 N. 34 N? 34 N. 39 N? 39 N. 44 N? Wait earlier we had 44 N. 49 N? 49 N. 54 N? 54 N. 59 N? 59 N. So 4 mod5 numbers also N.\n\nThus P positions are exactly numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. That matches pattern: differences 2,3 repeating produce all numbers equivalently 0 and 2 mod5.\n\nBut is this pattern fully correct? Let's double-check initial values: 0 P, 2 P, 5 P, 7 P, 10 P, 12 P, etc. They are indeed numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5? Let's compute modulo 5:\n\n0 %5 =0\n2%5=2\n5%5=0\n7%5=2\n10%5=0\n12%5=2\n15%5=0\n17%5=2\n20%5=0\n22%5=2\n25%5=0\n27%5=2\n30%5=0\n32%5=2\n35%5=0\n37%5=2\n40%5=0\n42%5=2\n45%5=0\n47%5=2\n50%5=0\n52%5=2\n55%5=0\n57%5=2\n60%5=0\n62%5=2? Wait 62 we didn't compute but pattern would hold. Should be P.\n\nThus pattern holds. We can prove via recursion: Because positions modulo 5 determine outcome in subtraction games with moves {1,4}.\n\nGeneral reasoning: The game of taking 1 or 4 tokens is a subtraction game with subtraction set S = {1,4}. The P-positions are known to have the property that they are periodic with period 5, with 0 and 2 as P-positions. Indeed, the Grundy function values repeat with period 5. Let's confirm by computing Grundy numbers.\n\nCompute Grundy numbers g(n) = mex{g(n-1), g(n-4)} for n>=1.\n\nInitialize g(0)=0.\n\nCompute:\n\nn=0: g(0)=0.\n\nn=1: g(1) = mex{ g(0)=0 } = 1. (since only option is remove 1 leads to g0=0). So g1=1.\n\nn=2: g(2) = mex{ g(1)=1 } = 0. So g2=0.\n\nn=3: g(3) = mex{ g(2)=0 } = 1. So g3=1.\n\nn=4: g(4)= mex{ g(3)=1, g(0)=0 } -> mex{0,1} = 2. So g4=2.\n\nn=5: g(5)= mex{ g(4)=2, g(1)=1 } -> mex{1,2} = 0. So g5=0.\n\nn=6: g6= mex{ g5=0, g2=0 } -> mex{0} = 1. g6=1.\n\nn=7: g7= mex{ g6=1, g3=1 } -> mex{1} = 0. g7=0.\n\nn=8: g8= mex{ g7=0, g4=2 } -> mex{0,2}=1? Wait mex of {0,2} is 1. So g8=1.\n\nn=9: g9 = mex{ g8=1, g5=0 } -> mex{0,1} = 2. g9=2.\n\nn=10: g10 = mex{ g9=2, g6=1 } -> mex{1,2} = 0. g10=0.\n\nObserving pattern: g(n) cycles with period 5: values [0,1,0,1,2]?\n\nLet's compute sequence of Grundy numbers for n=0..10:\n\nn: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\ng: 0 1 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 2 0\n\nYes, repeating 0,1,0,1,2. That is period 5. The P-positions are those with zero Grundy number. g(n) = 0 for n = 0,2,5,7,10,12,... That's exactly n mod5 in {0,2}? Wait check n mod5:\n\nn=0:0->0\nn5: 5%5=0->0\nn=10%5=0->0\nn=2%5=2->0\nn=7%5=2->0\nn=12%5=2->0\n\nYes.\n\nThus answer: Count number of positive integers n <= 2024 such that n mod5 in {0,2}. Excluding 0 because n positive. So we count numbers <=2024 which are 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWe need to count positive n. Let's find floor count:\n\n- Compute number of integers <=2024 that are 0 mod5: floor(2024/5) = ?\n\n2024 /5 = 404.8? Actually 5*404=2020. So up to 2024 there are 404 whole multiples. So numbers 5,10,...,2020 are 404 numbers. But 0 is also a multiple, but n positive, and 2024 may not be multiple of 5. We'll keep that.\n\nBut we also count numbers that are 2 mod5: numbers of form 5k+2 <=2024. Max k such that 5k+2 <=2024: k <= (2024-2)/5 = 2022/5 = 404.4 -> floor 404. So k=0 to 404 inclusive? Wait for positive n we may consider k starting from 0: 5*0+2=2; yes. So there are 405 such numbers? Let's count: from k=0 to 404 inclusive inclusive count = 404-0+1 = 405. Is that correct? Let's check: 5k+2 \u2264 2024. k max = floor((2024-2)/5) = floor(2022/5) = floor(404.4) = 404. So k=0..404 inclusive results in 405 numbers. Let's list some: 2,7,12,...,5*404+2=2020+2=2022? Wait 5*404 = 2020; +2 = 2022. So 2022 indeed <=2024. Good.\n\nWe also need to include multiples of 5 <=2024: 5* k <=2024 => k <=floor(2024/5)=404. So k=1 to 404 inclusive gives 404 numbers. But also k=0 gives 0, but 0 is not positive, so exclude. So 404 numbers.\n\nTotal: 404 + 405 = 809? Wait 404+405=809. Let's check: 404+405 = 809 indeed.\n\nThus the number of positive integers n <= 2024 such that n mod5 in {0,2} is 809.\n\nBut we need to double-check that the pattern holds for all n up to 2024. But we derived from recurrence and pattern period 5, so yes.\n\nHowever we should verify that we have not omitted any n like 2024? 2024 mod5 = 2024-2020=4. So 2024 is not in {0,2} mod5, so Bob does not have winning strategy for 2024. So 809 counts numbers up to 2023 maybe? But we included up to 2024 inclusive. Good.\n\nNow ensure calculation: For 2024 inclusive, number of numbers <=2024 with mod 5=0: 404 (5,10,...,2020). Numbers with mod5=2: 405 (2,7,...,2022). Total 809. Good.\n\nDouble-check counts:\n\nNumber of multiples of 5 up to N: floor(N/5). For N=2024 -> floor(2024/5) = 404. And 0 is counted if we included k=0. But we only counted positive n, and multiples start at 5. So 404 numbers.\n\nNow number of numbers \u22612 (mod 5) <= N: floor((N-2)/5)+1? Actually formula: For any N\u22652, the number of numbers \u2261 2 mod5 up to N is floor((N-2)/5)+1. But we must ensure not to double count 2? No.\n\nLet's compute: floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405. Yes.\n\nAdd 404 yields 809.\n\nAlternatively we can unify as floor(N/5)+floor((N+3)/5)?? Wait to double-check formula: Number of numbers \u22612 mod5 \u2264N is floor((N-2)/5)+1 if N\u22652 else maybe 0. For N\u22652, fine.\n\nLet's compute maybe using a different method: The numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5 can be enumerated as 5k or 5k+2. For 0: k from 1 to floor(N/5). For 2: k from 0 to floor((N-2)/5). So total floor(N/5)+floor((N-2)/5)+1. But careful with overlapping? No.\n\nFor N=2024: floor(N/5)=404; floor((N-2)/5)=floor(2022/5)=404. So total 404+404+1=809. Wait we earlier had 404 + 405? 405 is floor((N-2)/5)+1=404+1=405. So 404 + 405 = 809. In the sum formula we had 404+404+1=809. Good.\n\nNow we want positive integers n (i.e., n\u22651). We considered n=0 (which is P but not allowed). So answer 809.\n\nBut we should ensure that the initial reasoning that Bob's winning strategy exists if and only if n is a P-position is correct. In impartial combinatorial games with perfect play, the player whose turn arrives at a P-position is guaranteed to lose if both play optimally. So if Alice starts at a P-position, Alice loses, thus Bob wins. So yes Bob has winning strategy if n is P. So we need count of P up to 2024.\n\nThus answer 809.\n\nBut we should consider \"strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\" This is same as Bob being the second player. In impartial games with perfect play, if starting position is a P-position, then the first player loses assuming optimal play by second player. But careful: Some games are not necessarily symmetric? But this is subtraction game; it's impartial and deterministic; no chance.\n\nThus our answer stands.\n\nWe should provide reasoning step-by-step as requested.\n\nLet's produce final answer: $\\boxed{809}$.\n\nBut let's double-check to ensure we didn't miscount. Let's double-check with small N to confirm.\n\nCompute for N=10: Count numbers <=10 with mod 5 in {0,2}:\n\n- 0? Not positive. 5 (0 mod5) qualifies. 2 (2 mod5) qualifies. So numbers: 2,5. Also 7? Wait <=10 includes 7 (2 mod5), so 3 numbers 2,5,7? But 7 <=10 yes. So 3 numbers. Wait but also 0? No. So for N=10 we count 3. Let's compute using formula: floor(10/5)=2 (multiples of 5) -> 5 and 10? Wait 10 is multiple of 5 but >10? 10 is equal. So 5 and 10. 10 qualifies. So 2 multiples of 5: 5,10. For 2 mod5: numbers 2,7? 12 >10. So 2 numbers. Total 4. But earlier I counted 3. Let's recalc: numbers <=10 positive: 1 to 10 inclusive. Let's list which are P positions: According to our sequence, P positions <=10: 2,5,7,10. Wait 10 is P. Yes. So there are 4 numbers. Let's verify our earlier method: floor(10/5)=2 (multiples 5,10). floor((10-2)/5)+1 = floor(8/5)+1 = 1+1=2 (numbers 2,7). That's 2. Total 2+2 = 4. Yes. So 4 matches.\n\nSo count formula works.\n\nNow for N=2024:\n\n- Multiples: numbers 5,10,...,2020 -> 404\n- plus 2 mod5 numbers: 2,7,...,2022 -> 405\n\nTotal 809.\n\nDouble-check with an alternative: Let's find the sequence of P numbers up to 2024: 2,5,7,... 2022 maybe? 2024? 2024 is 4 mod5. So last P <=2024 is 2022. Let's calculate number: starting at 2, difference pattern: sequence defined by alternating 3 and 2 increments starting from 2? Actually starting from 2 up to 2022 inclusive. Let's compute number of terms: The sequence is 2,5,7,10,...,2022.\n\nWe can compute number of terms using formula: The nth P-positions form arithmetic progression? But it's not a simple arithmetic progression, but pattern repeating 5-length. Actually the positions n congruent to 0 or 2 mod5 are exactly those of the form 5k+2 or 5k. So count equals count of k such that 5k<=2024 and k>=1 + count of k such that 5k+2 <=2024 and k>=0. This yields 404 + 405 = 809.\n\nDouble-check: The largest multiple of 5 <=2024 is 2020. 2020 = 5*404. So 404 multiples. Largest number \u2261 2 mod5 <=2024 is 2022 = 5*404+2. That's k=404. So 405 terms. So total 809.\n\nThus answer is 809.\n\nNow we should explain the reasoning step-by-step. Also verify that for n=1 Bob doesn't have a winning strategy. Our calculations confirm that n=1 is N. So that's fine.\n\nLet's now present final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{809}$\n\nBut maybe we need to provide reasoning: \"For this subtraction game with allowed moves 1 and 4, the winning positions for second player are all n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5). Because we can compute Grundy numbers or by induction on n that P-positions are those values. So we count how many positive integers \u2264 2024 satisfy n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 5). That count is 404+405=809.\"\n\nAlso we can note that P-positions mod5 are 0 and 2.\n\nWe need to ensure we consider that Bob can guarantee to win if Alice's position is P. Because Bob is second player. So we indeed count such n.\n\nHence final answer: 809.\n\nNow let's craft final answer.\n\nWe can mention Grundy numbers: g(n) = mex(g(n-1), g(n-4)). Then show pattern repeated with period 5: g(n) = [0,1,0,1,2] repeating. So g(n)=0 iff n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5 => Bob wins. So count. Provide final answer.\n\nLet's produce final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nThat's it."

            "value": "The problem:\n\nGame: Nim-like with moves {1,4}. Alice starts. The player who removes last token wins. This is typical impartial combinatorial game, take-away game. Determine for which starting sizes n up to 2024 does Bob have a winning strategy regardless of Alice's play. Equivalent: Determine all n for which the first player (Alice) is in a losing position (so Bob has a winning strategy). So we need positions that are P-positions (previous player wins) i.e., losing for the player about to move. Since Alice is first, Bob will win exactly when n is a P-position (since Bob as second player will win). So find all positive integers n <= 2024 that are P-positions given moves {1,4}.\n\nLet's analyze the take-away game.\n\nDefine: P-positions: positions where the previous player (the one who just moved) wins, i.e., the next player to move (current) loses with optimal play.\n\nIn take-away games with moves set {1,4}, the P-positions are defined by recursion: a position n is P if none of the positions reachable in one move (i.e., n-1 or n-4 if non-negative) is P (i.e., all reachable positions are N, meaning winning for the player to move). Actually, more formally: n is a P-position if all moves from n lead to N-positions (i.e., winning for the player who has to move next). And n is N if there is at least one move to a P-position.\n\nSo compute P-positions recursively.\n\nWe can attempt to find a pattern.\n\nThe base: 0 tokens: previous player (who removed last token) wins. But our game start positions positive n. But we can use n=0 as P-position by convention, because if there are 0 tokens on your turn, you lose (the previous player removed last). So define n=0 as terminal position where the player to move loses, so it's a P-position. So indeed, n=0 is P (losing for next player). Then we compute upward.\n\nLet move set M = {1,4}.\n\nCompute positions:\n\n- n=0: P\n- n=1: Can remove 1 -> n=0 (P). So there is a move to a P position, so n=1 is N (winning for player).\n- n=2: Moves: remove 1 -> n=1 (N). remove 4 not possible. All reachable positions (only n=1) are N. So cannot force P, so n=2 is P.\n- n=3: Moves: remove 1 -> n=2 (P). So there is a winning move, so n=3 is N.\n- n=4: Moves: remove 1 -> n=3 (N). remove 4 -> n=0 (P). There exists a move to P (n=0). So n=4 is N.\n- n=5: Moves: remove 1 -> n=4 (N), remove 4 -> n=1 (N). All reachable N, so n=5 is P.\n- n=6: Moves: remove 1 -> n=5 (P) -> winning, so n=6 is N.\n- n=7: 1->6(N), 4->3(N). All reachable N, so n=7 is P.\n- n=8: 1->7(P). So n=8 N.\n- n=9: 1->8(N), 4->5(P). There is move to P. So n=9 N. Wait we need to check: 9-1=8 (N). 9-4=5 (P). So there is a move to P, so N.\n- n=10: 1->9(N). 4->6(N). All reachable N, so P.\n- n=11: 1->10(P) -> N.\n- n=12: 1->11(N), 4->8(N). All N, so P.\n- n=13: 1->12(P) -> N.\n- n=14: 1->13(N), 4->10(P). => N (since a move to P).\n- n=15: 1->14(N), 4->11(N). => P.\n- n=16: 1->15(P) => N.\n- n=17: 1->16(N), 4->13(N) => P.\n- n=18: 1->17(P) => N.\n- n=19: 1->18(N), 4->15(P) => N. Actually check: 19-1=18 (N), 19-4=15(P). So there is a winning move to 15 P; thus 19 N.\n- n=20: 1->19(N), 4->16(N) => P.\n- n=21: 1->20(P)=>N.\n- n=22: 1->21(N), 4->18(N) => P.\n- n=23: 1->22(P)=>N.\n- n=24: 1->23(N), 4->20(P) => N.\n- n=25: 1->24(N), 4->21(N) => P.\n- n=26: 1->25(P)=>N.\n- n=27: 1->26(N), 4->23(N)=>P.\n- n=28: 1->27(P)=>N.\n- n=29: 1->28(N), 4->25(P)=>N.\n- n=30: 1->29(N), 4->26(N)=>P.\n- n=31: 1->30(P)=>N.\n- n=32: 1->31(N), 4->28(N)=>P.\n- n=33: 1->32(P)=>N.\n- n=34: 1->33(N), 4->30(P)=>N.\n- n=35: 1->34(N), 4->31(N)=>P.\n- n=36: 1->35(P)=>N.\n- n=37: 1->36(N), 4->33(N)=>P.\n- n=38: 1->37(P)=>N.\n\nSeems pattern emerges: P-positions are maybe those congruent to 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15,... It's not obviously simple modulo something.\n\nBetter to compute and find recurrence or periodicity. Since moves are {1,4}, with maximum removal 4. For impartial take-away games with finite move set, the Sprague-Grundy sequence is eventually periodic with period at most something. For Nim-heap size n with 1,4, the P-positions will eventually be periodic with period equal to least common multiple of something? Actually for subtraction games with subtraction set S, the sequence of P-positions is known to be ultimately periodic with period dividing some function of S, often 2^k?? Actually the subtraction game with S {1,4} maybe has period of length 5? Let's test.\n\nLet's compute more values.\n\nWe have already computed up to n=38 maybe. We can compute further up to maybe > 42 to detect repeating pattern.\n\nLet's list P-positions found up to 38:\n\nIndices n and classification:\n\n0 P\n1 N\n2 P\n3 N\n4 N\n5 P\n6 N\n7 P\n8 N\n9 N\n10 P\n11 N\n12 P\n13 N\n14 N\n15 P\n16 N\n17 P\n18 N\n19 N\n20 P\n21 N\n22 P\n23 N\n24 N\n25 P\n26 N\n27 P\n28 N\n29 N\n30 P\n31 N\n32 P\n33 N\n34 N\n35 P\n36 N\n37 P\n38 N\n39... compute.\n\nNow we can derive pattern: The sequence of P-positions seems to follow a rule: After each group, there's a pattern of length maybe 5? Let's check consecutive P positions differences:\n\nDifferences between consecutive P positions: 2-0=2, 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 10-7=3, 12-10=2, 15-12=3, 17-15=2, 20-17=3, 22-20=2, 25-22=3, 27-25=2, 30-27=3, 32-30=2, 35-32=3, 37-35=2, 40-37=3? Wait 40? Let's compute n=39 and n=40 to confirm.\n\nLet's compute n=39:\n\nn=39: 1->38(N), 4->35(P) => N (move to P). So 39 N.\n\nn=40: 1->39(N), 4->36(N) => P. So 40 P. So difference 40-37=3. Good.\n\nNow differences continue: pattern 2,3,2,3,... repeating? Let's continue further.\n\nn=41: 1->40(P) => N.\n\nn=42: 1->41(N), 4->38(N) => P. So 42 P? Wait check: 42-1=41 (N), 42-4=38 (N). So all reachable are N -> P indeed. So 42 P. The difference 42-40=2. pattern 2,3,2,3,... continues.\n\nn=43: 1->42(P) -> N\n\nn=44: 1->43(N), 4->40(P) -> N. So 44 N.\n\nn=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N) -> P?\n\nI received a request from the user to provide an answer right now.

For subtraction game with moves {1,4}, the Nim-type positions repeat periodically. We can compute the initial P-positions.\n\nBut is there a pattern we can derive? The earlier reasoning gave pattern \"P positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...\"\n\nIt appears that P-positions have difference pattern: 2,3,2,3,... i.e., from 0 to 2 diff 2; 2 to 5 diff 3; 5 to 7 diff 2; 7 to 10 diff 3, etc. So P-positions are those with n mod 3 = 2? Wait: Let's check:\n\nList of P positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,...\n\nLet's compute n mod 3: 0 mod 3 = 0, 2 mod 3 = 2, 5 mod 3 = 2, 7 mod 3 = 1, 10 mod 3 = 1, 12 mod 3 = 0, 15 mod 3 = 0, 17 mod 3 = 2, 20 mod 3 = 2, 22 mod 3 = 1, 25 mod 3 = 1, 27 mod 3 = 0, 30 mod 3 = 0... This is not constant. So maybe P positions are those that are not 1 mod 4? Wait let's check: n=2 mod 3 includes 2,5,8,11,... doesn't match? 8 is not P: 8 is N. So it's not simple mod 3.\n\nBut we might have mis-calc: let's recompute carefully again.\n\nWait earlier we concluded that P positions follow pattern: differences 2,3 repeating. That would produce positions: Starting from 0: 0; +2 =>2; +3=>5; +2=>7; +3=>10; +2=>12; +3=>15; +2=>17; +3=>20; +2=>22; +3=>25; +2=>27; +3=>30; +2=>32; +3=>35; +2=>37; +3=>40; +2=>42; +3=>45; +2=>47; +3=>50, etc.\n\nLet's check whether 8 would be a P-position according to this rule: 8 is not in that sequence because it's 7 then 10 next. So 8 is N indeed. So the sequence 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nThus P positions mod something might be 0,2,2,1,1,0,0,2,... It's a repeating cycle of mod 6? Let's compute mod 5 maybe? 0 mod5=0; 2=2; 5=0; 7=2; 10=0; 12=2; 15=0; 17=2; 20=0; 22=2;... Actually pattern of mod5: 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,... So pattern: 0 or 2 mod 5. Wait but 0 mod5 at n=0,5,10,15,20,25,30, ... Yes. 2 mod5 at n=2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,... That matches indeed. So P-positions are exactly numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5? Let's check with 15: 15 mod5=0. 20 mod5=0. 25 mod5=0. 30 mod5=0. 35 mod5=0. Yes. 2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,... yes. In our pattern, 0 is P as well because it's the endpoint. But we start at n positive. So we count positive n <=2024 that are 0 mod5 or 2 mod5? But 0 mod5 includes 5,10,15,... But 0 itself is not positive. But 5 is indeed P, 10 is P, etc. And 2 mod5 includes 2,7,12,17,... Are those indeed all P positions? Let's verify some: n=2 is P (correct). 7 is P. 12 is P. 17 is P. 22 is P. 27 is P. 32 is P. 37 is P. So indeed that holds. So the pattern emerges: P positions are numbers that are 0 or 2 mod 5.\n\nWait check n=0: 0 mod5 => P. Good. So indeed the set is {n | n \u22610 or 2 (mod 5)}.\n\nBut earlier we also had representation as {n = 3q+2 or n=...}. That pattern seemed wrong now. Let's test: 3q+2 set: 2,5,8,11,14... but that includes 5 and 2, but 8 is not a P position. So that representation is wrong. The correct pattern for {0 or 2 mod5} emerges from the differences 2,3 repeating. Wait does that produce 0,2,5,... Yes. So mod5 representation is correct: sequence: 0,2,5,7,10,12,... Yes. So correct representation: n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod5). Let's verify for n=25: 25 mod5 =0 => P; yes. n=30 mod5=0; yes. n=32 mod5=2; yes. n=45 mod5=0; but 45 according to pattern earlier: we didn't compute 45 but we would anticipate 45 is P because 45 mod5=0. Let's check with manual: n=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N), so all N => P. Yes.\n\nSo we adopt that representation: P positions are n such that n \u2261 0 or 2 (mod5).\n\nHence positive n <=2024 that are P positions are numbers n with n \u2261 0, 2 (mod 5). Count them.\n\nWe need to count positive n <= 2024 that satisfy n \u22610 mod5 or n \u22612 mod5. Let's compute using arithmetic sequences:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 between 1 and 2024: smallest 5, largest floor(2024/5)*5 = (2024/5 = 404.8 => floor 404)*5 = 2020. So there are floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5: first 2, last? Compute largest \u22642024: largest k such that \\(5k+2 \\le 2024\\). Solve k <= (2022)/5 = 404.4 => floor 404. So largest is 5*404+2=2020+2=2022. So also 404 numbers.\n\nBut careful: we include n\u22651. 0 is not counted because they said positive integers only, so 0 is not included. But our counts start at 5 for \u22610 mod5 and 2 for \u22612 mod5. So we have 404 numbers for each class because 0 excluded but 0 is not in that range. But we need to confirm that 2020 (5*404) is indeed within \u22642024. Yes.\n\nSo total positive integers <=2024 that are \u22610 or 2 mod5: 404+404 = 808.\n\nWait we also counted n=2020 (5*404) which is indeed <=2024, yes. So 808 P-positions.\n\nHowever earlier I had 675 from misanalysis earlier. That was erroneous. Which one is correct? Let's double-check.\n\nHold on. The earlier pattern we computed earlier and wrote 675 was derived from n\u22612 mod3 incorrectly. That seems wrong now, because we realized the pattern is mod5. So we must double-check the entire reasoning.\n\nWe need to confirm that indeed for this game the set of P-positions is exactly those where n\u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet's test more positions for sanity:\n\nWe have computed manually up to n=45 (approx). Let's produce a table of n and classification.\n\nI earlier produced table up to 45.\n\nLet's compute further to confirm beyond 45, e.g., 50,53,55, etc.\n\nCompute systematically using recurrence:\n\nWe can compute iterative classification:\n\nWe already have up to n=45:\n\nn  P? \n0 P\n1 N\n2 P\n3 N\n4 N\n5 P\n6 N\n7 P\n8 N\n9 N\n10 P\n11 N\n12 P\n13 N\n14 N\n15 P\n16 N\n17 P\n18 N\n19 N\n20 P\n21 N\n22 P\n23 N\n24 N\n25 P\n26 N\n27 P\n28 N\n29 N\n30 P\n31 N\n32 P\n33 N\n34 N\n35 P\n36 N\n37 P\n38 N\n39 N\n40 P\n41 N\n42 P\n43 N\n44 N\n45 P\n46 N\n47 P? Let's compute.\n\nWait we didn't compute 46 and 47 earlier, let's do from 45 onwards:\n\nn=44: 44-1=43 (N), 44-4=40 (P) => 44 N?\n\nLet's double-check 44: 44-1=43 (N?). Wait we said 43 is N. Let's check 43: n=43: 1->42 (P) => 43 N. So 44: 44-1=43 (N). 44-4=40 (P). So 44 has a move to P (40). So 44 is N.\n\nNow n=45: 1->44(N), 4->41(N). So 45 P. That matches.\n\nNow n=46: 1->45 (P) => 46 N. So 46 N.\n\nn=47: 1->46 (N), 4->43 (N). Both N, so 47 P. Yes 47 fits pattern: 47 mod5 =2. So P.\n\nn=48: 1->47(P) -> N. So 48 N.\nn=49: 1->48(N), 4->45(P). So 49 N because has move to P. But 49 mod5 =4. So N.\n\nn=50: 1->49(N), 4->46(N). So 50 P. 50 mod5 =0. Yes.\n\nn=51: 1->50(P) -> N. So 51 N (51 mod5=1).\nn=52: 1->51(N), 4->48(N). So 52 P? Wait 52 mod5=2. But we need to check if 52 is indeed P: moves from 52: remove 1 ->51 (N). Remove 4 ->48 (N). So no P reachable, so 52 P. Yes.\n\nSo pattern holds: 52 is P and 52 mod5=2.\n\nContinue to confirm more:\n\nn=53: 1->52(P) -> N. So N. 53 mod5=3\nn=54: 1->53(N), 4->50(P). So N. 54 mod5=4\nn=55: 1->54(N), 4->51(N). So P. 55 mod5=0.\n\nWe can see pattern continues.\n\nHence indeed P positions: numbers \u22610 mod5 or \u22612 mod5.\n\nNow we need to find number of positive integers <=2024 that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nNow 2024/5=404.8, so floor floor is 404.\n\nList for mod5=0: 5,10,...,2020. There are 404 numbers.\n\nList for mod5=2: 2,7,12,...,2022? Wait 2022=5*404+2 = 2022. That's <=2024. So there are 404 numbers again. So sum = 808.\n\nDouble-check: Does 0 mod5 also include 0? We should not include zero because we only count positive. Yes.\n\nHence answer: total 808.\n\nThus Bob has a winning strategy for 808 values of n <=2024.\n\nBut earlier in the earlier analysis we had 675, which is wrong. We need to rectify.\n\nHowever earlier we earlier enumerated differences as 2,3 repeating which leads to mod5 classification: numbers that start at 0 then +2 ->2, +3 ->5, +2->7,... Indeed that yields numbers 0,2,5,7,10,12... That's exactly numbers that are either 0 or 2 mod5. Because difference is 2,3 repeating gives pattern: 0,2,5,7,10,12,... which is indeed such.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is 808.\n\nBut the reasoning earlier mis-copied that P positions were 0 or 2 mod3. Let's rectify.\n\nWe have to produce the final solution with reasoning, step-by-step.\n\nWe should mention that the game is impartial with subtractions {1,4} which is a subtraction game. It's known that the P-positions repeat periodically with period 5 for this set.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute Grundy numbers or compute the pattern.\n\nLet us produce final answer: 808.\n\nWe also might include explanation of classification via induction or algorithm:\n\nDefine the positions:\n\nLet \\(S = \\{1,4\\}\\). Define \\(a_n\\) to be Nim-value (SG) or classification. But simpler to classify by N vs P.\n\nWe can define the recurrence: A position \\(n\\) is P if and only if \\(n-1\\) and \\(n-4\\) (if positive) are N. Because only two moves.\n\nWe can check initial states and compute pattern until cycle arises.\n\nWe might also use the concept of Sprague-Grundy function g(n) = mex{g(n-1), g(n-4)}. Starting g(0)=0 (since 0 is terminal). Then we calculate successive g(n) until pattern emerges (g(n) repeats modulo 5). But we only need classification for P vs N: g(n)=0 indicates P. So we compute g(n) modulo?\n\nCompute g:\n\ng(0)=0\ng(1)=mex{g(0)}=mex{0}=1\ng(2)=mex{g(1)}=mex{1}=0 -> P\ng(3)=mex{g(2)}=mex{0}=1\ng(4)=mex{g(3),g(0)}=mex{1,0}=2? Wait, mex of {1,0} is 2. So g(4) = 2 > 0 => N.\ng(5)=mex{g(4),g(1)}=mex{2,1}=0? Since 0 not present, mex=0. So P.\ng(6)=mex{g(5)}=mex{0}=1. So N.\ng(7)=mex{g(6)}=mex{1}=0 => P\ng(8)=mex{g(7)}=mex{0}=1 => N\ng(9)=mex{g(8),g(5)}=mex{1,0}=2 => N\ng(10)=mex{g(9),g(6)}=mex{2,1}=0 => P\ng(11)=mex{g(10)}=mex{0}=1 => N\ng(12)=mex{g(11)}=mex{1}=0 => P\ng(13)=mex{g(12)}=mex{0}=1 => N\ng(14)=mex {g(13),g(10)}=mex{1,0}=2 => N\ng(15)=mex{g(14),g(11)}=mex{2,1}=0 => P\n...\nWe see pattern repeating after every 5: 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,... Actually g(n) pattern of period 5: 0,1,0,1,2 repeating? Let's check: sequence g: 0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,2,... The pattern: indices 0 mod 5 => 0; 1 mod 5 => 1; 2 mod 5 => 0; 3 mod 5 => 1; 4 mod 5 => 2.\n\nThus g(n)=0 at n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Yes. So P-positions are exactly n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Good. So that's a simpler argument.\n\nHence answer 808.\n\nLet's produce final answer with steps: compute Grundy numbers or classification, find period 5, count numbers \u22642024 of that congruence.\n\nNow I will produce final answer.\n\nBut note: The problem didn't specify that tokens can be removed at most 4 tokens. Actually player may remove either 1 token or 4 tokens at a turn. So the move set is {1,4}. Yes.\n\nThus final result: 808.\n\nWe can present in a nice format:\n\n- Compute Grundy function g(0)=0\n- For n\u22651: g(n)=mex{ g(n-1), g(n-4) } with convention g(k)=0 for k<0? Actually we treat negative indices as impossible so ignore them. So g(n)= mex of g(n-1) and g(n-4) for n>=4. For 1<=n<=3, handle separately. You compute g(0) =0, g(1)=1, g(2)=0, g(3)=1, g(4)=2, and then find pattern repeating every 5. So P-positions: g(n)=0 -> n\u22610 or 2 mod5. Counting yields 808.\n\nWe might also produce alternative proof by induction: state \"Claim: n is P iff n mod5 is 0 or 2\" and prove by induction.\n\nProof: Base cases n=0,1,2,3,4 verified. Inductive step: Suppose for all k<n, claim holds. Then n is P if and only if n-1 and n-4 are N, that is, if n-1\u22600,2 mod5 and n-4\u22600,2 mod5. That is, n-1\u22600 or 2 mod5 and n-4\u22600 or 2 mod5. Evaluate all possibilities modulo 5 leads to same pattern.\n\nBut easier: we derived pattern from Grundy numbers. So answer.\n\nThus we produce final answer 808.\n\nNow we need to respond with final answer boxed. Let's double-check the count again:\n\nNumber of numbers \u2264 2024 that are congruent to 0 mod5: floor(2024/5) = 404 numbers.\n\nNumber of numbers \u2264 2024 that are congruent to 2 mod5: floor((2024-2)/5) + 1? Usually for 2 mod 5 we get floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404+1? Wait careful:\n\nGeneral formula: The number of integers \u2264 N that are congruent to r mod m is floor((N-r)/m)+1 if r <= N. Because the smallest such number is r (\u22651) but r could be 0 but we exclude 0.\n\nBut we want positive integers \u22642024 and r=2. For N=2024.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., upto \u22642024. The difference between successive terms is 5. So count is floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404+1 = 405? Wait: 2022/5 = 404.4, floor=404. Then +1 => 405. That seems suspicious because previous reasoning gave 404 numbers. Let's compute explicit: 2,7,12,..., up to 2022 inclusive. Let's count:\n\nLet n_k = 2 + 5(k-1). We want n_k <= 2024. Solve 2 + 5(k-1) <=2024 => 5(k-1) <= 2022 => k-1 <= 404.4 => k <= 405.4. So k <= 405. So maximum integer k = 405. So there are 405 numbers? Wait: That gives k from 1 to 405 inclusive. So total 405. But earlier we thought 404. Let's double-check manually:\n\nLet's list a few terms: k=1 => 2; k=2 => 7; k=3 => 12; ... increments of 5.\n\nCheck k=405: n_405 = 2 + 5(404) = 2 + 2020 = 2022. That's \u22642024. So 405 values. But earlier we used floor(2024/5) = 404 for 0 mod5. For 2 mod5, maybe it's 404+1 =405. So that means total count of P-positions is 404 + 405 = 809, not 808.\n\nWait earlier we counted 404 numbers for each, but maybe the 2 mod5 should indeed be 405.\n\nLet's double-check careful arithmetic.\n\nCount of n <= N with n \u2261 a (mod m) for 1 <= a <= m, where a may be 0 (for 0 mod m). But we consider positive a.\n\nGeneral formula: number of solutions to n \u2261 r (mod m), 1 <= n <= N, r between 1 and m inclusive. Count = floor((N - r)/m) + 1 if r <= N. But if r > N, then zero. For r = 2, N = 2024. Compute floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404 + 1 = 405. Because floor(2022/5) = 404 (since 5*404 = 2020, remainder 2). So indeed 405 numbers.\n\nBut earlier we incorrectly computed as 404 due to misinterpreting floor(2024/5) = 404. But that formula is for r = 0 mod m? Let's check: Count of n \u2261 0 (mod 5) from 1 to 2024.\n\nn = 5k, k positive integer, <= 2024 -> 5k <= 2024 => k <= 404.8 => k <= 404. So there are 404 numbers for 0 mod 5. That is correct.\n\nNow count of n \u2261 2 mod 5: n = 5k+2, k >=0, <=? Wait when k=0, n=2 -> allowed. When k=404, n=5*404+2=2022. That's allowed. When k=405, n=5*405+2=2027 > 2024, not allowed. So k ranges from 0 to 404 inclusive => 405 values. So indeed there are 405 numbers.\n\nYes, so the total P-positions count is 404+405=809.\n\nThus earlier mis count: 808 vs 809. Let's double-check again to avoid mis counts.\n\nNow we must check potential double counting if any number is both 0 mod 5 and 2 mod 5? No. So it's fine. Sum = 809.\n\nBut we need to double-check the number of P-positions found for small n: For n <=10: P positions: 0,2,5,7. So positive ones: 2,5,7 => 3 numbers.\n\nOur formula would give: floor(10/5) = 2 numbers with 0 mod5: {5,10}. Wait 10 is also P? Let's confirm n=10 is P. So 0 mod5 numbers <=10: {5,10} => 2. Non-zero.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 <=10: {2,7} => 2. That yields 2 + 2 =4 positive P positions? But from enumeration earlier, we had P positive positions: 2,5,7. Wait we forgot 10 as P? We had that 10 is P earlier. Let's check earlier table: 10 is P indeed. So P positions up to 10: 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers, matches our formula: 2 + 2 =4. Good.\n\nSo formula holds for small N.\n\nNow test for N=15: P positions: we listed earlier 2,5,7,10,12,15. That's 6 numbers. 0 mod5 <=15: {5,10,15} => 3. 2 mod5 <=15: {2,7,12} => 3. Sum = 6. Good.\n\nThus the pattern is consistent.\n\nNow we compute for N=2024: 0 mod5 <=2024: 5,10,...,2020. That's 404 numbers as computed: floor(2024/5)=404. Because 5*404=2020. 0 mod5 numbers <=2024 count = 404.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 <=2024: 2,7,...,2022. Count = floor((2024-2)/5)+1 = floor(2022/5)+1 = 404 +1=405. So total P positive positions count=404+405 = 809.\n\nThus Bob can win for 809 starting token counts.\n\nBut earlier we derived that the period might be 5, indeed.\n\nLet's confirm period 5 yields 5 possible residue classes. If g(n) pattern is 0,1,0,1,2 repeating, then g(n)=0 (P) at residues 0 and 2 mod 5. So there are 2 out of 5 residues that are P. So probability that a random n <= 2024 is P is approx 2/5. So approximate count of N <=2024: 2024*(2/5) = 1616.8, but we must count precisely. 2024 /5 = 404.8. Multiply by 2 => 809.6? Wait 404.8*2 = 809.6? Actually 404.8*2 = 809.6, but number must be integer. Real count is 809. That matches. Because 2024 not divisible by 5 exactly. For n=2024, there are floor(N/5)*2 + extra for remainder beyond floor(N/5)*5. Let's compute precisely: floor(N/5)=404, remainder R = 4. For each complete block of five numbers, there are 2 P values. That's 404*2=808. Then we need to consider the last partially block: numbers 2020+1=2021, 2022, 2023, 2024. Among those, P at the positions that are 2 mod5 or 0 mod5 beyond 2020: The numbers in that block: 2021 \u22611 mod5; 2022 \u22612 mod5 => P; 2023 \u22613 mod5; 2024 \u22614 mod5. So within the final remainder of 4 numbers, only 2022 is P. So add 1. So total 808+1=809. Good. So indeed 809.\n\nThus answer: 809.\n\nBut we need to reflect on the earlier error: we incorrectly counted 404+404. That miscount would produce 808. Let's verify with quick enumeration for n <= 30: The P positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30. That's 12 positions. According to our formula, 0 mod5 <=30: {5,10,15,20,25,30} => 6. 2 mod5 <=30: {2,7,12,17,22,27} => 6. Sum=12. Good. So 0 mod5 and 2 mod5 yield same count for N=30. For general N the counts differ by at most 1.\n\nTherefore 809 answer is correct.\n\nBut the earlier mis-calc came from incorrectly counting 2 mod5 as 404. So we correct.\n\nThus final answer is 809.\n\nNow the question: \"Find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\" That is the same as counting P-positions.\n\nThus answer: number is 809.\n\nDouble-check: Could we consider n=0 as positive? No. They said positive integers n. So n has to be at least 1. 0 is not counted. So we should not include n=0. But we should check if 0 mod5 positions start at 5: 5,10,..., which are all positive. So it's fine. And 2 mod5 start at 2: 2,7,..., all positive. So we counted correctly.\n\nThus 809. Let's produce final answer with explanation of pattern and counting.\n\nNow produce final output:\n\n\"Let g(n) be the Grundy number for n. g(0)=0. For n\u22651, g(n)=mex{g(n\u22121),g(n\u22124)}. Compute sequence: ... repeating period 5: 0,1,0,1,2. Thus g(n)=0 (P) iff n\u22610 or 2 (mod 5). Hence Bob wins precisely when n \u22610 or 2 (mod 5). Counting those n \u22642024: For n\u22610 (mod 5) we have 404 numbers (5,10,\u2026,2020). For n\u22612 (mod 5) we have 405 numbers (2,7,12,\u2026,2022). Total 404+405=809. So answer is \\boxed{809}.\"\n\nBut we need to be mindful of possible misinterpretation: maybe the game ends when no tokens remain; a player removes last token and wins. Our classification is correct: n=0 => previous player wins. So P-positions as described.\n\nCheck if there's any nuance: \"The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either 1 token or 4 tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins.\" This is a normal play Nim. So yes.\n\nThus answer stands as 809.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n\nBut the assistant must format answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nSo deliver final solution with explanation.\n\nOk.\n\nLet's create final answer.\n\n<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Let \\(S=\\{1,4\\}\\) be the set of legal moves.  \nDefine the Sprague\u2011Grundy value (the nim\u2011value) \\(g(n)\\) of a heap of \\(n\\) tokens by  \n\n\\[\ng(0)=0,\\qquad   \ng(n)=\\operatorname{mex}\\{\\,g(n-1),\\,g(n-4)\\,\\}\\qquad(n\\ge 1)\n\\]\n\n(with the convention that an illegal subtraction is ignored).  \nThe position is a losing one for the player to move (a *P\u2011position*) iff \\(g(n)=0\\).\n\n---\n\n### 1.

Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We are given the lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of rectangles. In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.\n\nNow, since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's try to sketch this. Let's assume the line DEC is horizontal for simplicity. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for coordinate geometry. Wait, maybe coordinate geometry will help here. Let's assign coordinates to the points.\n\nLet me define the coordinate system. Let's let the line DEC be the x-axis. Let\u2019s place point D at (0, 0). Since D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, let's denote the coordinates:\n\nLet D = (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to BC. Let's assume AB is vertical. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB and BC are adjacent sides, so if BC is horizontal (along the x-axis), then AB is vertical.\n\nWait, if D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, let's assume the x-axis is the line DEC.\n\nLet me set D at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's say:\n\n- D = (0, 0)\n- Since BC = 16, and ABCD is a rectangle, BC is a side. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB and CD are one pair of opposite sides, BC and AD are the other pair.\n\nLet me fix the coordinates properly.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the line DEC is the x-axis. Let\u2019s let D be at (d, 0), E at (e, 0), C at (c, 0), F at (f, 0), with d < e < c < f (assuming the order is D-E-C-F, but maybe the order is different? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but it doesn't specify the order. Hmm, this is important. Maybe we need to consider the order.\n\nIn rectangles, the vertices are in order, so ABCD is a rectangle, so AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF, FG, GH, HE are consecutive sides.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, let's consider the possible orders. Let's assume the order on the line is D, E, C, F. So D---E---C---F on the line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is between D and C, or C is between D and E, etc. Maybe we need to figure out the configuration.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G are concyclic (lie on a circle). That might give us some angle conditions or power of a point.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let's set the line DEC as the x-axis. Let\u2019s let D be at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's assume AB is vertical. So:\n\n- D = (0, 0)\n- Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AB = 107. Let's assume AB is vertical, so A is at (0, 107) because AB = 107 (wait, AB is the length, so if AB is vertical, then A = (0, AB) = (0, 107), and B = (BC, AB) = (16, 107), since BC = 16. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the coordinates would be:\n\nIf D = (0, 0), then since AD is a side, let's say AD = BC = 16, so A = (0, 16), B = (107, 16), C = (107, 0), because AB = 107, BC = 16. Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because in rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are length 107, BC and AD are length 16.\n\nSo:\n\n- A = (0, 16)\n- B = (107, 16)\n- C = (107, 0)\n- D = (0, 0)\n\nNow, D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis (since we set D and C on x-axis). So the line is the x-axis. So D = (0, 0), C = (107, 0). Then E and F are also on the x-axis, so E = (e, 0), F = (f, 0) for some e, f.\n\nNow, EFGH is a rectangle. Let's figure out its coordinates. EF = 184, FG = 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and GH are length 184, FG and EH are length 17.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the orientation of EFGH. Since E is on the x-axis at (e, 0), and F is at (f, 0). Since EF is a side of the rectangle, EF could be along the x-axis or vertical. But since E and F are on the x-axis, if EF is a side, then if EF is horizontal, then the rectangle is either above or below the x-axis. But since A, D, H, G are concyclic, and A, D are at (0,16) and (0,0), which are above the x-axis, so H and G are probably also above the x-axis, so the rectangle EFGH is likely above the x-axis.\n\nSo let's assume EFGH is above the x-axis. Then:\n\nIf E = (e, 0), F = (f, 0), and EF is the side of length 184. Since it's a rectangle, EF could be horizontal or vertical. If EF is horizontal, then the length EF = |f - e| = 184, and then the next side FG is vertical, length 17, so G = (f, 17), H = (e, 17).\n\nAlternatively, if EF is vertical, then |f - e| = 0 (but then it's a point, which is impossible), so EF must be horizontal. Wait, no, if EF is vertical, then E and F would have the same x-coordinate, but since they are on the x-axis (y=0), then E = (e, 0), F = (e, 0), which is the same point, so that's impossible. Therefore, EF must be horizontal, so the side EF is along the x-axis, so |f - e| = 184, and then FG is vertical, so G = (f, 17), H = (e, 17).\n\nWait, but FG = 17, which is the length of FG, so if F = (f, 0), G = (f, 17), then FG = 17, which matches. Similarly, EH = 17, so H = (e, 17), E = (e, 0), so EH = 17, which matches. EF = |f - e| = 184, which matches.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the order of D, E, C, F on the x-axis. D is at (0, 0), C is at (107, 0). Let's assume the order is D, E, C, F, so 0 < e < 107 < f. Alternatively, maybe E is to the left of D, or F is to the left of D, but let's see.\n\nNow, the other condition is that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let's write their coordinates:\n\n- A = (0, 16)\n- D = (0, 0)\n- H = (e, 17) [Wait, hold on: if EFGH is the rectangle, with E = (e, 0), F = (f, 0), then H should be the next vertex. In rectangle EFGH, the vertices are E, F, G, H, so from E to F to G to H to E. So if E = (e, 0), F = (f, 0), then G = (f, g), H = (e, g), where g is the height, which is FG = 17, so g = 17. So H = (e, 17), G = (f, 17). Yes.\n\nSo A = (0, 16), D = (0, 0), H = (e, 17), G = (f, 17). These four points lie on a circle.\n\nLet me recall that four points lie on a circle if the determinant for concyclicity is zero, or we can use the power of a point, or check that the angles subtended by a chord are equal, etc.\n\nAlternatively, since three of the points are known, we can find the circle and then the fourth must lie on it.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17). Let's find the circle through these three points.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.\n\nSince D(0,0) is on the circle: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nA(0,16): 0 + 256 + 0 + 32f + 0 = 0 => 256 + 32f = 0 => f = -8.\n\nSo the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2gx - 16y = 0.\n\nNow, H(e,17) is on the circle, so:\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g e - 16*17 = 0\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0\n\ne\u00b2 + 17 + 2g e = 0\n\n2g e = -e\u00b2 - 17\n\ng = (-e\u00b2 - 17)/(2e) (assuming e \u2260 0)\n\nNow, G(f, 17) is also on the circle, so:\n\nf\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + 2g f - 16*17 = 0\n\nf\u00b2 + 289 + 2g f - 272 = 0\n\nf\u00b2 + 17 + 2g f = 0\n\n2g f = -f\u00b2 - 17\n\ng = (-f\u00b2 - 17)/(2f) (assuming f \u2260 0)\n\nNow, we have two expressions for g, so:\n\n(-e\u00b2 - 17)/(2e) = (-f\u00b2 - 17)/(2f)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(-e\u00b2 - 17)/e = (-f\u00b2 - 17)/f\n\nMultiply both sides by ef (assuming e \u2260 0, f \u2260 0):\n\n(-e\u00b2 - 17)f = (-f\u00b2 - 17)e\n\n- e\u00b2 f - 17 f = - f\u00b2 e - 17 e\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- e\u00b2 f - 17 f + f\u00b2 e + 17 e = 0\n\nFactor:\n\ne f (-e + f) + 17 (-f + e) = 0\n\ne f (f - e) - 17 (f - e) = 0\n\n(f - e)(e f - 17) = 0\n\nSo either f - e = 0 or e f = 17.\n\nBut f - e = 0 would mean E = F, which is impossible because EF = 184 \u2260 0, so we must have e f = 17.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So e f = 17.\n\nNow, recall that EF = 184. Since EF is the distance between E(e, 0) and F(f, 0), so |f - e| = 184.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1. |f - e| = 184\n\n2. e f = 17\n\nWait, but hold on, is the order of E and F? If the order on the line is D, E, C, F, then e < f, so f - e = 184. If the order is different, maybe e > f, so |f - e| = 184.\n\nBut let's assume first that f > e, so f = e + 184.\n\nThen, from e f = 17, we have e(e + 184) = 17\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0\n\nSolutions: e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2\n\nBut 184\u00b2 is a large number, and 17 is small, so one solution is positive, one negative.\n\nBut e is a coordinate on the x-axis, and D is at 0, C at 107. If e is negative, that means E is to the left of D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different. Maybe the line is D, C, E, F or something else. Let's check.\n\nWait, maybe we assumed the orientation of the rectangle EFGH. Maybe the rectangle is below the x-axis? Let's see.\n\nIf EFGH is below the x-axis, then H = (e, -17), G = (f, -17). Then the circle through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(f, -17).\n\nLet's check that.\n\nCircle through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17).\n\nAgain, circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2g x + 2f y + c = 0.\n\nD(0,0): c = 0.\n\nA(0,16): 0 + 256 + 0 + 32 f + 0 = 0 => f = -8.\n\nSo circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 2g x - 16 y = 0.\n\nH(e, -17): e\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e - 16*(-17) = 0\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + 2g e + 272 = 0\n\ne\u00b2 + 561 + 2g e = 0\n\n2g e = -e\u00b2 - 561\n\ng = (-e\u00b2 - 561)/(2e)\n\nG(f, -17): f\u00b2 + 289 + 2g f - 16*(-17) = 0\n\nf\u00b2 + 289 + 2g f + 272 = 0\n\nf\u00b2 + 561 + 2g f = 0\n\n2g f = -f\u00b2 - 561\n\ng = (-f\u00b2 - 561)/(2f)\n\nSet equal:\n\n(-e\u00b2 - 561)/(2e) = (-f\u00b2 - 561)/(2f)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(-e\u00b2 - 561)/e = (-f\u00b2 - 561)/f\n\nMultiply by ef:\n\n(-e\u00b2 - 561)f = (-f\u00b2 - 561)e\n\n- e\u00b2 f - 561 f = - f\u00b2 e - 561 e\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n- e\u00b2 f - 561 f + f\u00b2 e + 561 e = 0\n\ne f (f - e) + 561 (e - f) = 0\n\n(f - e)(e f - 561) = 0\n\nSo f = e or e f = 561.\n\nSince EF = 184, |f - e| = 184, so e f = 561.\n\nThis is possible. Now, 561 = 3*11*17, 184 = 8*23, so maybe e and f are real numbers.\n\nBut let's see which case is more plausible. The problem is that if the rectangle is below the x-axis, the circle through A, D, H, G might not make sense, but it's possible. However, the problem doesn't specify the orientation, so we need to consider both.\n\nBut let's first stick with the first case where EFGH is above the x-axis, so H = (e, 17), G = (f, 17), and we had e f = 17, |f - e| = 184.\n\nBut 17 is prime, so e and f would be factors of 17, but 184 is much larger than 17, so e and f would be approximately \u00b1184/2 = \u00b192, and their product is 17, which is possible (since 92*(-92) = -8464, but 17 is positive, so both same sign). If e and f are both positive, then e + f = 184 (if f > e) or e - f = 184 (if e > f). Wait, |f - e| = 184, so if e and f are both positive, then f = e + 184, so e(e + 184) = 17, which as I said, e is negative because e\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0, discriminant 184\u00b2 + 68, which is positive, so e = [-184 + sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2, which is positive? Wait, sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68) > 184, so -184 + sqrt(...) > 0, so e is positive, f = e + 184 is also positive, and e f = 17.\n\nWait, 184 is much larger than 17, so e is a small positive number, f = e + 184 is approximately 184, and e * 184 \u2248 17, so e \u2248 17/184 \u2248 0.092, which is small, so that's possible.\n\nNow, we need to find CE. Since C is at (107, 0), E is at (e, 0), so CE = |107 - e|.\n\nBut we need to find e. From e f = 17 and f = e + 184 (assuming f > e), so e(e + 184) = 17\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0\n\nSolutions: e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2\n\nWe take the positive root because if e is negative, then f = e + 184 might still be positive, but let's check.\n\nWait, if e is negative, then f = e + 184 could be positive or negative. If e is negative and f = e + 184 is positive, then e f = 17 (positive), so both e and f positive or both negative. Since 17 is positive, so either both positive or both negative.\n\nIf both negative, then |f - e| = |e - f| = |negative - negative| = |negative| = |e - f|, but if e < f < 0, then f - e = negative, so |f - e| = e - f = 184, so e - f = 184, and e f = 17.\n\nLet\u2019s consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: e and f positive, f = e + 184, e f = 17.\n\nCase 2: e and f negative, e = f + 184 (since |f - e| = 184, and e < f < 0, so e - f = 184), and e f = 17.\n\nLet's see which case makes sense with the configuration.\n\nFirst, let's consider Case 1: e > 0, f = e + 184 > 0, e f = 17.\n\nThen CE = |107 - e|. Since e is positive and small (\u22480.092), CE \u2248 107 - e \u2248 107, which is possible.\n\nCase 2: e < f < 0, e = f + 184, e f = 17.\n\nThen f + (f + 184) f = 17 => f\u00b2 + 184 f + 17 = 0, which is the same equation as in Case 1, so f = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2, but since f is negative, we take the negative root: f = [-184 - sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2, which is negative, then e = f + 184 = [ -184 - sqrt(...) + 2*184 ] / 2 = [184 - sqrt(...)] / 2. Since sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68) > 184, so e is negative, which matches.\n\nNow, CE = |107 - e|. Since e is negative, CE = 107 - e = 107 + |e|, which is larger than 107. Maybe both cases are possible, but we need to see which one satisfies the collinear order.\n\nThe problem says \"D, E, C, F are collinear\". It doesn't specify the order, so we need to consider possible orders.\n\nLet's assume the order is D, E, C, F on the line. Then coordinates: D(0,0), E(e,0), C(107,0), F(f,0), so 0 < e < 107 < f.\n\nIn Case 1: e > 0, f = e + 184. If f > 107, then e + 184 > 107 => e > -77, which is true since e > 0. So 0 < e < 107 < f, which fits the order D, E, C, F.\n\nIn Case 2: e < f < 0, so the order would be F, E, D, C (since f < e < 0 < 107), so D, E, C, F would not be in that order, so probably Case 1 is the correct one.\n\nSo let's go with Case 1: e > 0, f = e + 184, e f = 17.\n\nNow, we need to find CE = 107 - e (since e < 107, as f = e + 184 > 107, so e > 107 - 184 = -77, but e > 0, so 0 < e < 107).\n\nNow, from e f = 17 and f = e + 184, so e(e + 184) = 17 => e\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0.\n\nWe need to find 107 - e. Let's see if we can find this without solving for e.\n\nLet\u2019s denote x = CE = 107 - e, so e = 107 - x.\n\nThen f = e + 184 = 107 - x + 184 = 291 - x.\n\nFrom e f = 17, so (107 - x)(291 - x) = 17\n\nLet's expand this:\n\n107*291 - 107 x - 291 x + x\u00b2 = 17\n\nx\u00b2 - (107 + 291)x + 107*291 - 17 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 - 398 x + (107*291 - 17) = 0\n\nNow, we need to compute 107*291.\n\nLet me compute 100*291 = 29100, 7*291 = 2037, so 29100 + 2037 = 31137.\n\nSo 107*291 = 31137, so 31137 - 17 = 31120.\n\nThus, x\u00b2 - 398 x + 31120 = 0\n\nLet's check if this factors. Let's see, discriminant D = 398\u00b2 - 4*1*31120\n\n398\u00b2 = (400 - 2)\u00b2 = 160000 - 1600 + 4 = 158404\n\n4*31120 = 124480\n\nD = 158404 - 124480 = 33924\n\nNow, sqrt(33924). Let's see, 184\u00b2 = 33856, 185\u00b2 = 34225, so between 184 and 185. 184\u00b2 = 33856, 33924 - 33856 = 68, so not a perfect square? Wait, but maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, 184\u00b2 = (200 - 16)\u00b2 = 40000 - 6400 + 256 = 33856, correct. 33924 - 33856 = 68, so sqrt(33924) = sqrt(33856 + 68) = 184 + 68/(2*184) + ... by binomial, but maybe not a perfect square. Wait, but maybe the problem is designed so that this is a perfect square. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign.\n\nWait, in the circle equation, when we considered the circle through A, D, H, G, we assumed the order of the points. Maybe the circle is such that the points are in a different order, so the concyclicity condition might be different.\n\nWait, another way to check concyclicity: the power of point A with respect to the circle, or use the cyclic quadrilateral condition that the product of diagonals is equal, or the angles.\n\nAlternatively, use the condition that for four points to be concyclic, the cross ratio is real, or use the fact that the perpendicular bisectors meet at the center.\n\nAlternatively, use the condition that the angle ADH equals angle AGH or something, but maybe coordinate geometry is still the way.\n\nWait, let's verify the circle equation again.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(f,17).\n\nSince A and D are on the y-axis (x=0), the perpendicular bisector of AD is the horizontal line y=8.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of HG: H(e,17), G(f,17), midpoint ((e+f)/2, 17), and since HG is horizontal, the perpendicular bisector is vertical line x=(e+f)/2.\n\nSo the center of the circle is at ((e+f)/2, 8).\n\nNow, the distance from center to A should equal distance to D.\n\nDistance to D(0,0): [(e+f)/2]^2 + 8^2\n\nDistance to A(0,16): [(e+f)/2]^2 + (16 - 8)^2 = [(e+f)/2]^2 + 64, which is the same, so that checks out.\n\nNow, distance from center to H(e,17) should be equal to distance to D.\n\nDistance to D: [(e+f)/2]^2 + 64\n\nDistance to H: [(e+f)/2 - e]^2 + (8 - 17)^2 = [(f - e)/2]^2 + 81\n\nSet equal:\n\n[(e+f)/2]^2 + 64 = [(f - e)/2]^2 + 81\n\nLet's expand:\n\n(e+f)\u00b2 / 4 + 64 = (f - e)\u00b2 / 4 + 81\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n(e+f)\u00b2 + 256 = (f - e)\u00b2 + 324\n\nExpand (e+f)\u00b2 = e\u00b2 + 2 e f + f\u00b2, (f - e)\u00b2 = f\u00b2 - 2 e f + e\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\ne\u00b2 + 2 e f + f\u00b2 + 256 = e\u00b2 - 2 e f + f\u00b2 + 324\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 e f + 256 = 324\n\n4 e f = 324 - 256 = 68\n\ne f = 68 / 4 = 17\n\nAh! There we go! I made a mistake earlier in the circle equation. Let's check this.\n\nYes, this is a better way. The center is at ((e+f)/2, 8), because the perpendicular bisector of AD (which is vertical line x=0) is horizontal line y=8, and perpendicular bisector of HG (which is horizontal line y=17) is vertical line x=(e+f)/2. So center at ((e+f)/2, 8).\n\nThen, distance from center to D(0,0) is sqrt( [(e+f)/2]^2 + 8^2 )\n\nDistance from center to H(e,17) is sqrt( [(e+f)/2 - e]^2 + (8 - 17)^2 ) = sqrt( [(f - e)/2]^2 + 81 )\n\nSet equal:\n\n[(e+f)/2]^2 + 64 = [(f - e)/2]^2 + 81\n\nWhich leads to:\n\n(e\u00b2 + 2 e f + f\u00b2)/4 + 64 = (e\u00b2 - 2 e f + f\u00b2)/4 + 81\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\ne\u00b2 + 2 e f + f\u00b2 + 256 = e\u00b2 - 2 e f + f\u00b2 + 324\n\nSimplify:\n\n4 e f = 68 => e f = 17\n\nYes! So that's correct. So my initial calculation was correct, e f = 17.\n\nNow, EF = 184, which is the distance between E(e,0) and F(f,0), so |f - e| = 184.\n\nNow, we need to consider the sign. If the order is D, E, C, F, then e < f, so f - e = 184.\n\nIf the order is D, F, C, E, then f < e, so e - f = 184, but let's assume the first case.\n\nSo f = e + 184.\n\nThen e f = e(e + 184) = 17 => e\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0.\n\nNow, we need to find CE. C is at (107, 0), E is at (e, 0), so CE = |107 - e|.\n\nLet's assume that the points are in the order D, E, C, F, so 0 < e < 107 < f. Then CE = 107 - e.\n\nLet\u2019s let x = CE = 107 - e, so e = 107 - x.\n\nThen f = e + 184 = 107 - x + 184 = 291 - x.\n\nFrom e f = 17, so (107 - x)(291 - x) = 17.\n\nExpand:\n\n107*291 - 107 x - 291 x + x\u00b2 = 17\n\nx\u00b2 - 398 x + (107*291 - 17) = 0\n\nAs before, 107*291: 100*291=29100, 7*291=2037, so 29100+2037=31137, so 31137 - 17=31120.\n\nSo x\u00b2 - 398 x + 31120 = 0.\n\nNow, let's compute discriminant D = 398\u00b2 - 4*31120.\n\n398\u00b2 = (400 - 2)\u00b2 = 160000 - 1600 + 4 = 158404.\n\n4*31120 = 124480.\n\nD = 158404 - 124480 = 33924.\n\nNow, let's see if 33924 is a perfect square.\n\nLet's check 184\u00b2 = 33856, 185\u00b2=34225, so 184\u00b2=33856, 33924-33856=68, so not 184.\n\n184.1\u00b2 = 184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.1 + 0.1\u00b2 = 33856 + 36.8 + 0.01 = 33892.81, still less than 33924.\n\n184.2\u00b2 = 33892.81 + 2*184.1*0.1 + 0.1\u00b2 \u2248 33892.81 + 36.82 + 0.01 = 33929.64, which is more than 33924, so not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe the order is different.\n\nWait, maybe the order of the collinear points is D, C, E, F. So 0 < 107 < e < f.\n\nThen CE = e - 107.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nLet CE = e - 107 = x, so e = 107 + x.\n\nThen f = e + 184 = 107 + x + 184 = 291 + x.\n\nFrom e f = 17, so (107 + x)(291 + x) = 17\n\nx\u00b2 + (107 + 291)x + 107*291 - 17 = 0\n\nx\u00b2 + 398 x + 31137 - 17 = x\u00b2 + 398 x + 31120 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = 398\u00b2 - 4*31120 = same as before, 33924, which is positive, so real solutions, but x would be negative because 398 x + x\u00b2 + 31120 = 0, so x = [-398 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)] / 2, which is negative, so e = 107 + x < 107, which contradicts e > 107, so this case is impossible.\n\nAnother possibility: the order is E, D, C, F. So e < 0 < 107 < f.\n\nThen CE = 107 - e (since e < 0, CE = 107 - e > 107).\n\nLet\u2019s take e negative, f positive, so e f = 17 (positive), so f = 17 / e (since e f = 17).\n\nAlso, |f - e| = 184. Since f > 0, e < 0, so f - e = 184 (because f - e > 0).\n\nSo f - e = 184, and f = 17 / e.\n\nSo 17 / e - e = 184\n\nMultiply by e (e \u2260 0):\n\n17 - e\u00b2 = 184 e\n\ne\u00b2 + 184 e - 17 = 0, which is the same equation as before.\n\nSolutions: e = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2\n\nTake the negative root: e = [-184 - sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2 (since the other root is positive, which we considered earlier)\n\nThen f = 17 / e = 17 / [ (-184 - sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)) / 2 ] = -34 / (184 + sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68))\n\nBut since f > 0, this is negative, which contradicts f > 0. Wait, no: if e is negative, f = 17 / e is negative, so both e and f negative, which is the other case we considered earlier.\n\nSo if both e and f are negative, then the order on the line is F, E, D, C (since f < e < 0 < 107), so D, E, C, F would be in the order D, C, F, E, which is not the same as the problem states, but the problem just says they are collinear, not in that order.\n\nBut let's see what CE is in this case.\n\nIf e and f are both negative, with f < e < 0 (since |f - e| = 184, and f - e = -184, so e - f = 184).\n\nLet\u2019s let e - f = 184, so e = f + 184.\n\nThen e f = 17 => (f + 184) f = 17 => f\u00b2 + 184 f - 17 = 0.\n\nSolutions: f = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2. Take the negative root: f = [-184 - sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2 (since the other root is positive, which we discard because f < 0).\n\nThen e = f + 184 = [ -184 - sqrt(...) + 2*184 ] / 2 = [184 - sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2, which is negative because sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68) > 184.\n\nNow, CE = |107 - e| = 107 - e (since e < 0 < 107).\n\nSo CE = 107 - e = 107 - [184 - sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)] / 2 = (214 - 184 + sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)) / 2 = (30 + sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)) / 2.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and the problem likely expects an integer answer, so maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate setup.\n\nWait, let's double-check the rectangle coordinates.\n\nIn rectangle ABCD, the sides: AB = 107, BC = 16.\n\nIn standard notation, ABCD is a rectangle with AB, BC, CD, DA as consecutive sides, so AB is adjacent to BC, so angle at B is 90 degrees.\n\nSo if we place D at (0,0), then:\n\n- D = (0, 0)\n\n- C = (BC, 0) = (16, 0) because BC = 16? Wait a second! Here's the mistake!\n\nOh no! I assumed BC = 16, so if D is at (0,0), then C should be at (16, 0), not (107, 0). Because BC is a side of the rectangle, so BC is the length from B to C.\n\nLet me correct this.\n\nLet's define the rectangle ABCD with D at (0,0).\n\nIn rectangle ABCD:\n\n- D = (0, 0)\n\n- C = (BC, 0) = (16, 0) because BC = 16\n\n- B = (16, AB) = (16, 107) because AB = 107 (since AB is the side from A to B, which should be vertical if BC is horizontal)\n\n- A = (0, 107) because AD = BC = 16? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal: AB = CD, BC = AD.\n\nSo AB = 107, so CD = 107; BC = 16, so AD = 16.\n\nSo if D = (0, 0), then:\n\n- A = (0, AD) = (0, 16) because AD = 16\n\n- B = (AB, 16) = (107, 16) because AB = 107\n\n- C = (107, 0) because BC = 16 (from (107,16) to (107,0) is length 16)\n\nWait, yes! BC is the vertical side? Wait, no. In a rectangle, the sides are perpendicular, so if AB and BC are adjacent sides, then AB is horizontal, BC is vertical, or vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Rectangles ABCD and EFGH\", so the order of the letters matters. In a rectangle ABCD, the vertices are in order, so AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides, so AB is perpendicular to BC.\n\nSo let's fix the coordinate system properly.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that in rectangle ABCD, AB is horizontal, BC is vertical.\n\nSo:\n\n- Let\u2019s place A at (0, 0)\n\n- Then B = (AB, 0) = (107, 0) because AB = 107\n\n- C = (107, BC) = (107, 16) because BC = 16\n\n- D = (0, 16) because CD = AB = 107 (from (107,16) to (0,16) is 107), and DA = BC = 16 (from (0,16) to (0,0) is 16)\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nNow, D, E, C, F are collinear. Let's find their coordinates.\n\nD = (0, 16), C = (107, 16). So the line DC is horizontal at y = 16.\n\nSo the line DEC is y = 16.\n\nNow, E and F are also on this line, so E = (e, 16), F = (f, 16) for some e, f.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let's define its coordinates.\n\nEF = 184, FG = 17.\n\nAssuming EFGH is oriented similarly, with EF horizontal, FG vertical.\n\nSo:\n\n- E = (e, 16)\n\n- F = (e + 184, 16) if EF is horizontal to the right, or (e - 184, 16) if to the left.\n\n- G = (e + 184, 16 + 17) = (e + 184, 33) if FG is upward, or (e + 184, 16 - 17) = (e + 184, -1) if downward.\n\n- H = (e, 33) or (e, -1) respectively.\n\nNow, the other condition: A, D, H, G lie on a circle.\n\nA = (0, 0), D = (0, 16), H, G.\n\nLet's consider the case where EFGH is above the line DC (y=16), so G = (e + 184, 33), H = (e, 33).\n\nNow, four points: A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e,33), G(e+184,33) lie on a circle.\n\nLet's find the circle through these points.\n\nFirst, A and D are on the y-axis (x=0). The perpendicular bisector of AD: midpoint (0, 8), and since AD is vertical, the perpendicular bisector is horizontal line y=8.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of HG: H(e,33), G(e+184,33), midpoint (e + 92, 33), and since HG is horizontal, the perpendicular bisector is vertical line x = e + 92.\n\nSo the center of the circle is at (e + 92, 8).\n\nNow, the distance from center to A(0,0) should equal distance to D(0,16).\n\nDistance to A: sqrt( (e + 92)^2 + 8^2 )\n\nDistance to D: sqrt( (e + 92)^2 + (16 - 8)^2 ) = sqrt( (e + 92)^2 + 64 ), which is the same, so that checks out.\n\nNow, distance from center to H(e,33) should equal distance to A.\n\nDistance to H: sqrt( (e + 92 - e)^2 + (8 - 33)^2 ) = sqrt(92^2 + (-25)^2 ) = sqrt(8464 + 625) = sqrt(9089)\n\nDistance to A: sqrt( (e + 92)^2 + 64 )\n\nSet equal:\n\nsqrt(9089) = sqrt( (e + 92)^2 + 64 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n9089 = (e + 92)^2 + 64\n\n(e + 92)^2 = 9089 - 64 = 9025\n\ne + 92 = \u00b1sqrt(9025)\n\nsqrt(9025): 95\u00b2 = 9025 (since 90\u00b2=8100, 95\u00b2=9025), yes! 95*95=9025.\n\nSo e + 92 = \u00b195\n\nThus, e = -92 \u00b1 95\n\nSo e = -92 + 95 = 3 or e = -92 - 95 = -187\n\nNow, we need to consider the collinear points D, E, C, F.\n\nD = (0,16), C = (107,16), so the line is y=16.\n\nE = (e,16), F = (e + 184,16) (since EF = 184, assuming direction to the right; if to the left, F = (e - 184,16), but let's assume to the right first).\n\nNow, the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear, which they are since all are on y=16. Now, we need to see the order.\n\nCase 1: e = 3\n\nThen E = (3,16), F = (3 + 184,16) = (187,16)\n\nSo the order on the line y=16 is D(0,16), E(3,16), C(107,16), F(187,16), which fits D, E, C, F collinear in that order.\n\nCase 2: e = -187\n\nThen E = (-187,16), F = (-187 + 184,16) = (-3,16)\n\nSo the order is F(-3,16), E(-187,16), D(0,16), C(107,16), which is not D, E, C, F in that order, but the problem just says they are collinear, so both are possible, but let's check which one makes sense.\n\nNow, we need to find CE.\n\nC is at (107,16), E is at (e,16), so CE = |107 - e|\n\nIn Case 1: e = 3, so CE = |107 - 3| = 104\n\nIn Case 2: e = -187, so CE = |107 - (-187)| = |294| = 294\n\nNow, we need to check if the other case where EFGH is below the line DC (y=16) is possible.\n\nIf EFGH is below, then G = (e + 184, 16 - 17) = (e + 184, -1), H = (e, -1)\n\nThen the circle through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(e, -1), G(e+184, -1)\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AD: y=8 as before.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of HG: midpoint (e + 92, -1), vertical line x = e + 92.\n\nCenter at (e + 92, 8)\n\nDistance to H: sqrt(92\u00b2 + (8 - (-1))\u00b2) = sqrt(8464 + 81) = sqrt(8545)\n\nDistance to A: sqrt( (e + 92)^2 + 64 )\n\nSet equal:\n\n8545 = (e + 92)^2 + 64 => (e + 92)^2 = 8481\n\n8481: 92\u00b2=8464, 93\u00b2=8649, so not a perfect square, so this case is likely not the intended one, so we can ignore it.\n\nNow, back to the two cases from the upper rectangle.\n\nIn Case 1, CE = 104, which is a nice number, and likely the answer.\n\nLet's verify if A, D, H, G are concyclic in Case 1.\n\ne = 3, so H = (3, 33), G = (187, 33)\n\nCircle center at (e + 92, 8) = (95, 8)\n\nRadius squared: (95 - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2 = 9025 + 64 = 9089\n\nDistance from center to H(3,33): (95 - 3)^2 + (8 - 33)^2 = 92\u00b2 + (-25)^2 = 8464 + 625 = 9089, which matches.\n\nDistance to G(187,33): (95 - 187)^2 + (8 - 33)^2 = (-92)^2 + (-25)^2 = same as above, 9089, so it works.\n\nNow, check if the problem's conditions are satisfied.\n\nBC = 16: in our coordinate system, BC is from B(107,0) to C(107,16), which has length 16, correct.\n\nAB = 107: from A(0,0) to B(107,0), length 107, correct.\n\nFG = 17: from F(187,16) to G(187,33), length 17, correct.\n\nEF = 184: from E(3,16) to F(187,16), length 184, correct.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\nIn Case 2, CE = 294, but let's see if it's possible, but since the problem likely expects a smaller answer, and 104 is an integer, probably 104 is the answer.\n\nWait, let's confirm the order. The problem says \"D, E, C, F are collinear\", which in Case 1 they are in the order D, E, C, F (x-coordinates 0, 3, 107, 187), which is fine.\n\nIn Case 2, the order is F, E, D, C, which also satisfies collinearity, but CE = 294, which is larger, and the problem might expect the smaller one, but we need to check if both are valid.\n\nHowever, the problem doesn't specify the orientation, but in many geometry problems, the configuration is assumed to be such that the rectangles are on the same side unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlso, let's see if the circle in Case 2 makes sense. e = -187, so H = (-187, 33), G = (-187 + 184, 33) = (-3, 33)\n\nCenter at (e + 92, 8) = (-187 + 92, 8) = (-95, 8)\n\nRadius squared: (-95)^2 + 8^2 = 9025 + 64 = 9089\n\nDistance to H(-187,33): (-95 - (-187))^2 + (8 - 33)^2 = (92)^2 + (-25)^2 = same, so it also works.\n\nBut why would the problem specify the lengths if both are possible? Maybe there's a constraint we missed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Rectangles ABCD and EFGH are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear. Also, A,D,H,G all lie on a circle.\"\n\nIn the coordinate system, for Case 1, the circle is above the line DC, and for Case 2, also above, but the rectangles are on different sides.\n\nBut maybe both are valid, but the problem expects the answer 104, as it's more likely.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's another condition.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the rectangles are labeled ABCD and EFGH, so the order of the vertices matters for the sides.\n\nIn rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.\n\nIn rectangle EFGH, the sides are EF, FG, GH, HE.\n\nIn our coordinate system for Case 1:\n\n- ABCD: A(0,0), B(107,0), C(107,16), D(0,16) \u2013 correct, AB=107, BC=16.\n\n- EFGH: E(3,16), F(187,16), G(187,33), H(3,33) \u2013 correct, EF=184, FG=17.\n\nNow, CE is the distance from C(107,16) to E(3,16), which is |107 - 3| = 104, which is the answer.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- EFGH: E(-187,16), F(-3,16), G(-3,33), H(-187,33) \u2013 EF=184, FG=17, correct.\n\nCE = |107 - (-187)| = 294.\n\nNow, the problem might have both solutions, but likely the intended one is 104, as it's smaller and the configuration is more natural (E between D and C).\n\nLet me check if the problem says \"drawn such that\", which might imply a specific configuration, so probably the one where E is between D and C.\n\nThus, the answer is 104.

Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We are given the lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.\n\nFirst, let's recall some properties of rectangles. In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.\n\nNow, since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's try to sketch this. Let's assume the line DEC is horizontal for simplicity. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for coordinate geometry. Wait, maybe coordinate geometry will help here. Let's assign coordinates to the points.\n\nLet me define the coordinate system. Let's let the line DEC be the x-axis. Let\u2019s place point D at (0, 0). Since D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, let's denote the coordinates:\n\nLet D = (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is perpendicular to BC. Let's assume AB is vertical. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB and BC are adjacent sides, so if BC is horizontal (along the x-axis), then AB is vertical.\n\nWait, if D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis, let's assume the x-axis is the line DEC.\n\nLet me set D at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's say:\n\n- D = (0, 0)\n- Since BC = 16, and ABCD is a rectangle, BC is a side. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB and CD are one pair of opposite sides, BC and AD are the other pair.\n\nLet me fix the coordinates properly.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the line DEC is the x-axis. Let\u2019s let D be at (d, 0), E at (e, 0), C at (c, 0), F at (f, 0), with d < e < c < f (assuming the order is D-E-C-F, but maybe the order is different? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, but it doesn't specify the order. Hmm, this is important. Maybe we need to consider the order.\n\nIn rectangles, the vertices are in order, so ABCD is a rectangle, so AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF, FG, GH, HE are consecutive sides.\n\nSince D, E, C, F are collinear, let's consider the possible orders. Let's assume the order on the line is D, E, C, F. So D---E---C---F on the line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is between D and C, or C is between D and E, etc. Maybe we need to figure out the configuration.\n\nAlso, A, D, H, G are concyclic (lie on a circle). That might give us some angle conditions or power of a point.\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let's set the line DEC as the x-axis. Let\u2019s let D be at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's assume AB is vertical. So:\n\n- D = (0, 0)\n- Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC = 16, AB = 107. Let's assume AB is vertical, so A is at (0, 107) because AB = 107 (wait, AB is the length, so if AB is vertical, then A = (0, AB) = (0, 107), and B = (BC, AB) = (16, 107), since BC = 16. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the coordinates would be:\n\nIf D = (0, 0), then since AD is a side, let's say AD = BC = 16, so A = (0, 16), B = (107, 16), C = (107, 0), because AB = 107, BC = 16. Wait, yes, that makes sense. Because in rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are length 107, BC and AD are length 16.\n\nSo:\n\n- A = (0, 16)\n- B = (107, 16)\n- C = (107, 0)\n- D = (0, 0)\n\nNow, D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis (since we set D and C on x-axis). So the line is the x-axis. So D = (0, 0), C = (107, 0). Then E and F are also on the x-axis, so E = (e, 0), F = (f, 0) for some e, f.\n\nNow, EFGH is a rectangle. Let's figure out its coordinates. EF = 184, FG = 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and GH are length 184, FG and EH are length 17.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the orientation of EFGH. Since E is on the x-axis at (e, 0), and F is at (f, 0). Since EF is a side of the rectangle, EF could be along the x-axis or vertical.

Alternatively, we can use the condition that the product of distances from a point to two chords are equal.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward method is to use the fact that the angle at H and G should be supplementary or equal (opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral).

Let's check 92^2 = 8464, 92.6^2 = 8574.76, so 8481 - 8464 = 17, so 92 + x, (92 + x)^2 = 8464 + 184x + x^2 = 8481, so 184x + x^2 = 17. x is small, so x \u2248 17/184 \u2248 0.092, so not integer. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, the perpendicular bisector of AD: AD is from (0,0) to (0,16), which is vertical, so perpendicular bisector is horizontal line y=8, correct.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of HG: HG is horizontal from (e,17) to (e+184,17), so perpendicular bisector is vertical line x = e + 92, correct.\n\nCenter at (e + 92, 8). Then distance from center to D(0,0) is sqrt((e + 92)^2 + 8^2), to H(e,17) is sqrt((e - (e + 92))^2 + (17 - 8)^2) = sqrt(92^2 + 9^2) = sqrt(8464 + 81) = sqrt(8545). So:\n\n(e + 92)^2 + 64 = 8545\n\n(e + 92)^2 = 8545 - 64 = 8481\n\nWait, 8481. Let's see if 8481 is a square. 92^2 = 8464, 93^2 = 8649, so no. Maybe miscalculation.\n\nWait, 17 - 8 = 9, so (17-8)^2 = 81, 92^2 = 8464, so 8464 + 81 = 8545, correct.\n\n(e + 92)^2 + 64 = 8545 => (e + 92)^2 = 8481. Wait, maybe 8481 = 9*942.333, not helpful. Maybe factor 8481.\n\nDivide by 3: 8+4+8+1=21, divisible by 3. 8481 / 3 = 2827. 2827: 2827 / 7 = 403.857, /11=257, 11*257=2827? 11*250=2750, 11*7=77, 2750+77=2827, yes! So 8481=3*11*257. Not a square. So maybe my assumption of the rectangle orientation is wrong.\n\nMaybe EF is not along the x-axis. Maybe EF is vertical. Let's consider that.\n\nAlternative coordinate setup: Let\u2019s assume that in rectangle EFGH, EF is vertical. So if E is at (e, 0) on the x-axis (line DEC), then F is at (e, 17) because FG = 17 (if FG is horizontal). Wait, FG = 17, so if EF is vertical, then EF = 184, so F = (e, 184), and G = (e + 17, 184), H = (e + 17, 0). Wait, let's clarify.\n\nIf EFGH is a rectangle with E on the x-axis at (e, 0). If EF is vertical, then F = (e, 184), then FG is horizontal, so G = (e + 17, 184), H = (e + 17, 0).\n\nNow, points A, D, H, G are concyclic. Coordinates:\n\n- A = (0, 16)\n- D = (0, 0)\n- H = (e + 17, 0)\n- G = (e + 17, 184)\n\nNow, let's find the circle through these four points.\n\nFirst, D(0,0) and H(e+17,0) are on the x-axis, so the circle intersects the x-axis at D and H. The perpendicular bisector of DH is x = (e+17)/2, y=0 to y=0, so the center is at ((e+17)/2, k).\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of AD: AD is from (0,0) to (0,16), midpoint (0,8), perpendicular bisector is y=8. So the center is at ((e+17)/2, 8).\n\nNow, radius squared is distance from center to D: ((e+17)/2)^2 + 8^2.\n\nAlso, distance from center to G(e+17, 184) should be equal:\n\n\\[\n(e+17 - (e+17)/2)^2 + (184 - 8)^2 = ((e+17)/2)^2 + 176^2\n\\]\nThis should equal radius squared, which is ((e+17)/2)^2 + 64.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n((e+17)/2)^2 + 176^2 = ((e+17)/2)^2 + 64\n\\]\n\\[\n176^2 = 64, which is false. So this orientation is impossible. So EF must be horizontal.\n\nBack to the first coordinate system. Maybe the order on the line is D, C, E, F, so e > 107. Then CE = e - 107.\n\nIn the equation (e + 92)^2 = 8481, let's compute sqrt(8481). 92^2=8464, 92.1^2=8464 + 2*92*0.1 + 0.01=8464+18.4+0.01=8482.41, which is more than 8481, so e + 92 \u2248 92.09, so e \u2248 0.09, which is near D, so order D-E-C-F.\n\nBut then CE = 107 - e \u2248 107 - 0.09 \u2248 106.91, which is not integer, but the problem likely has an integer answer, so maybe my coordinate assignment is off.\n\nWait, maybe AB is horizontal. Let's try that.\n\nLet\u2019s reassign coordinates with AB horizontal.\n\nLet D = (0, 0), C = (16, 0) because BC = 16 (if BC is horizontal), and AB = 107 vertical. Wait:\n\nIn rectangle ABCD, if AB = 107, BC = 16, then:\n\n- A = (0, 107)\n- B = (16, 107)\n- C = (16, 0)\n- D = (0, 0)\n\nNow, line DEC is x-axis, so D(0,0), E(e,0), C(16,0), F(f,0).\n\nEFGH is rectangle with EF = 184, FG = 17.\n\nAssume EF is horizontal, so E(e,0), F(e+184,0), G(e+184,17), H(e,17).\n\nPoints A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17) are concyclic.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AD: AD is from (0,0) to (0,107), midpoint (0,53.5), perpendicular bisector is y=53.5.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of HG: HG is from (e,17) to (e+184,17), midpoint (e+92,17), perpendicular bisector is x = e+92.\n\nCenter of circle is at (e+92, 53.5).\n\nRadius squared is (e+92)^2 + (53.5)^2 (distance to D(0,0)).\n\nDistance to H(e,17) should be equal:\n\n\\[\n(e - (e+92))^2 + (17 - 53.5)^2 = 92^2 + (-36.5)^2 = 8464 + 1332.25 = 9796.25\n\\]\nAlso, radius squared is (e+92)^2 + 53.5^2 = (e+92)^2 + 2862.25.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n(e+92)^2 + 2862.25 = 9796.25\n\\]\n\\[\n(e+92)^2 = 6934\n\\]\n\\[\ne + 92 = \\sqrt{6934} \\approx 83.27, so e \u2248 -8.73, which is left of D, so order E-D-C-F.\n\nThen CE = |16 - e| = 16 - e (since e < 0).\n\nBut 6934 is not a perfect square (83^2=6889, 84^2=7056), so again not integer. Maybe the rectangle is oriented differently.\n\nWait, maybe the line DEC has D, E, C, F in the order D, F, C, E or other. Alternatively, use similar triangles or power of a point.\n\nSince A, D, H, G are concyclic, by power of a point, the angle ADH = angle AGH or something. Alternatively, use Ptolemy's theorem for quadrilateral ADHG.\n\nPtolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the product of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides.\n\nIn quadrilateral ADHG, diagonals are AH and DG.\n\nAD = 16, DH = ? Wait, need lengths.\n\nIn our first coordinate system:\n\nAD = 16 (from (0,0) to (0,16)).\n\nDH: distance from D(0,0) to H(e,17) is sqrt(e^2 + 17^2)\n\nAG: distance from A(0,16) to G(e+184,17) is sqrt((e+184)^2 + 1^2)\n\nDG: distance from D(0,0) to G(e+184,17) is sqrt((e+184)^2 + 17^2)\n\nAH: distance from A(0,16) to H(e,17) is sqrt(e^2 + 1^2)\n\nPtolemy's theorem: AD*HG + AH*DG = AG*DH\n\nBut HG = 17 (given, since FG=17, and HG=FG in rectangle), AD=16.\n\nSo:\n\n16*17 + sqrt(e^2 + 1)*sqrt((e+184)^2 + 17^2) = sqrt((e+184)^2 + 1)*sqrt(e^2 + 17^2)\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe the terms with sqrt(e^2 + 1) etc. cancel if e=0, but e=0 is point D, which is already on the circle, so not possible.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that the circle through A, D, H, G implies that the angle at D and G are related.\n\nThe angle ADH = angle AGH (since cyclic quadrilateral).\n\nVector approach might help, but maybe too time-consuming.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the line DEC is the x-axis, and the rectangles are oriented so that AB and EF are vertical.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let D be at (0,0), C at (c,0), so BC = 16, so c = 16 (since BC is horizontal). Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB is vertical, so A = (0, a), B = (16, a), D = (0,0), C = (16,0), so AB = a = 107, BC = 16. Correct.\n\nSo:\n\nA = (0, 107), B = (16, 107), C = (16, 0), D = (0, 0)\n\nE = (e, 0), F = (f, 0) on x-axis.\n\nEFGH is rectangle, EF = 184, FG = 17. Assume EF is vertical, so E = (e, 0), F = (e, 184), G = (e + 17, 184), H = (e + 17, 0)\n\nNow, points A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e+17,0), G(e+17,184) are concyclic.\n\nLet\u2019s find the circle through these four points.\n\nGeneral circle equation: x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n\nFor D(0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F=0\n\nFor A(0,107): 0 + 107^2 + 0 + 107E + 0 = 0 => 11449 + 107E = 0 => E = -11449/107 = -107 (since 107*107=11449)\n\nFor H(e+17,0): (e+17)^2 + 0 + D(e+17) + 0 + 0 = 0 => (e+17)(e+17 + D) = 0. Since e+17 \u2260 0 (otherwise H=D), so D = -(e+17)\n\nFor G(e+17,184): (e+17)^2 + 184^2 + D(e+17) + E*184 = 0\n\nPlug in D = -(e+17), E = -107:\n\n(e+17)^2 + 33856 - (e+17)^2 - 107*184 = 0\n\n33856 - 107*184 = 0?\n\nCalculate 107*184: 100*184=18400, 7*184=1288, total=19688\n\n33856 - 19688 = 14168 \u2260 0. So this is not zero, which means our assumption that EF is vertical is incorrect.\n\nWait, but if we assume EF is horizontal, then:\n\nE = (e,0), F = (e+184,0), G = (e+184,17), H = (e,17)\n\nCircle through A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17)\n\nF=0 from D(0,0)\n\nFor A(0,107): 107^2 + 107E = 0 => E = -107\n\nFor H(e,17): e^2 + 17^2 + De + 17*(-107) = 0 => e^2 + 289 + De - 1819 = 0 => e^2 + De - 1530 = 0 => D = (1530 - e^2)/e\n\nFor G(e+184,17): (e+184)^2 + 17^2 + D(e+184) + 17*(-107) = 0\n\nPlug D:\n\n(e+184)^2 + 289 + [(1530 - e^2)/e](e+184) - 1819 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(e+184)^2 - 1530 + [(1530 - e^2)(e+184)]/e = 0\n\nMultiply by e:\n\ne(e+184)^2 - 1530e + (1530 - e^2)(e+184) = 0\n\nExpand:\n\ne(e^2 + 368e + 184^2) - 1530e + 1530e + 1530*184 - e^3 - 184e^2 = 0\n\ne^3 + 368e^2 + 33856e - 1530e + 1530*184 - e^3 - 184e^2 = 0\n\n(368e^2 - 184e^2) + (33856e - 1530e) + 1530*184 = 0\n\n184e^2 + 32326e + 1530*184 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n92e^2 + 16163e + 765*184 = 0\n\nThis still looks messy. Maybe there's a geometric insight.\n\nSince A, D, H, G are concyclic, the power of point C with respect to this circle is CA * CD (but CD is a side). Wait, power of C is CE * CF = CA * CD? Wait, no. The line DEC passes through C, E, F, D. The circle intersects this line at D and possibly another point, say P. Then by power of a point:\n\nCE * CF = CD * CP\n\nBut we don't know P. Alternatively, if the circle intersects the line at D and another point, but maybe the circle is tangent at D, but not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates but assume that the circle has center on the perpendicular bisector of AD and HG.\n\nIn the first coordinate system where A=(0,16), D=(0,0), H=(e,17), G=(e+184,17):\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AD: y=8\n\nPerpendicular bisector of HG: x = e + 92\n\nSo center at (e + 92, 8)\n\nRadius squared: (e + 92)^2 + 8^2\n\nDistance from center to A: (e + 92)^2 + (8 - 16)^2 = (e + 92)^2 + 64, which matches, so no new info.\n\nDistance from center to G: (e + 92 - (e + 184))^2 + (8 - 17)^2 = (-92)^2 + (-9)^2 = 8464 + 81 = 8545\n\nSo:\n\n(e + 92)^2 + 64 = 8545\n\n(e + 92)^2 = 8481\n\nWait, 8481. Let's check if 8481 = 9*942.333, but 9*942=8478, 8481-8478=3, not divisible by 9. 8481 / 3 = 2827, as before. 2827 / 11 = 257, which is prime (since 16^2=256, so check primes up to 13: 257 not divisible by 2,3,5,7,11,13). So 8481=3*11*257, not a square. This suggests that maybe the rectangles are arranged with D, E, F, C collinear, i.e., the order is D, E, F, C.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the order is D, E, F, C on the x-axis.\n\nSo D=0, E=e, F=f, C=c=107 (in the first coordinate system where C is at (107,0)).\n\nSo E and F are between D and C.\n\nLet\u2019s use the first coordinate system:\n\nA=(0,16), D=(0,0), C=(107,0)\n\nE=(e,0), F=(f,0), 0 < e < f < 107\n\nEFGH rectangle: EF=184, but if e < f < 107, then EF = f - e = 184, but f < 107, so e = f - 184 < 107 - 184 = -77, so e < 0, which is possible (E is left of D).\n\nSo e < 0, f = e + 184, and 0 < f < 107 => 0 < e + 184 < 107 => -184 < e < -77.\n\nNow, the circle through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17)\n\nCenter at (e + 92, 8) as before.\n\nRadius squared: (e + 92)^2 + 64 = 8545 (same as before)\n\nSo (e + 92)^2 = 8481\n\nNow, CE = |107 - e| = 107 - e (since e < 0)\n\nWe need to find 107 - e.\n\nLet\u2019s let x = e + 92, so x^2 = 8481\n\nThen e = x - 92\n\nCE = 107 - (x - 92) = 199 - x\n\nSo CE = 199 - x, and x = sqrt(8481)\n\nBut the problem likely has an integer answer, so maybe 8481 is a square. Wait, 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649, so no. Maybe I made a mistake in the circle center.\n\nWait, the perpendicular bisector of AD: AD is from (0,0) to (0,16), midpoint (0,8), perpendicular bisector is y=8, correct.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of HG: HG is from (e,17) to (e+184,17), midpoint (e+92,17), perpendicular bisector is x = e + 92, correct.\n\nSo center is (e+92, 8), correct.\n\nDistance to D: sqrt((e+92)^2 + 8^2)\n\nDistance to G: sqrt((e+184 - (e+92))^2 + (17 - 8)^2) = sqrt(92^2 + 9^2) = sqrt(8464 + 81) = sqrt(8545), correct.\n\nSo (e+92)^2 + 64 = 8545 => (e+92)^2 = 8481\n\nNow, 8481. Let's check 92^2=8464, 92.1^2=8464 + 2*92*0.1 + 0.01=8464+18.4+0.01=8482.41, which is 1.41 more than 8481, so e+92 \u2248 92.05, so e \u2248 0.05, which is near D, so CE \u2248 107 - 0.05 \u2248 106.95, close to 107, but not integer.\n\nWait, maybe the circle is defined differently. Maybe the order of the points on the circle is A, D, G, H, so the cyclic order is important.\n\nAlternatively, use the condition that the cross ratio is real, but maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Since both rectangles are on the line DEC, and A, D, H, G are concyclic, maybe the triangles ADH and AGH are similar or something.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinate geometry with variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote CE = x. We need to find x.\n\nIn the line DEC, let\u2019s let D be at 0, C at c = BC = 16? Wait, in the rectangle, BC is a side. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, BC is a side, length 16, so if DEC is the line, then DC = AB = 107 (since in rectangle, opposite sides are equal). Wait, yes! In rectangle ABCD, DC = AB = 107, and BC = AD = 16.\n\nSo if we set D at 0, C at 107 on the x-axis.\n\nSo:\n\n- D = 0, C = 107 on the x-axis.\n\nLet E = e, F = f on the x-axis.\n\nEF = 184, so |f - e| = 184.\n\nFG = 17, and since EFGH is a rectangle, the height is 17, so the y-coordinate of H and G is 17 (assuming EF is on x-axis).\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- A = (0, 16) (since AD = 16, vertical)\n- B = (107, 16)\n- C = (107, 0)\n- D = (0, 0)\n- E = (e, 0)\n- F = (e + 184, 0) (assuming e < f)\n- G = (e + 184, 17)\n- H = (e, 17)\n\nNow, A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17) lie on a circle.\n\nThe condition for four points to be concyclic is that the determinant for the circle equation is zero, or use the power of a point.\n\nThe general circle equation: x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n\nFor D(0,0): F = 0\n\nFor A(0,16): 256 + 16E = 0 => E = -16\n\nFor H(e,17): e^2 + 289 + De - 272 = 0 => e^2 + De + 17 = 0 => D = -(e^2 + 17)/e\n\nFor G(e+184,17): (e+184)^2 + 289 + D(e+184) - 272 = 0\n\nSubstitute D:\n\n(e+184)^2 + 17 + [-(e^2 + 17)/e](e+184) = 0\n\nMultiply by e:\n\ne(e+184)^2 + 17e - (e^2 + 17)(e+184) = 0\n\nExpand e(e^2 + 368e + 184^2) + 17e - (e^3 + 184e^2 + 17e + 17*184) = 0\n\ne^3 + 368e^2 + 33856e + 17e - e^3 - 184e^2 - 17e - 3128 = 0\n\n(368e^2 - 184e^2) + (33856e) - 3128 = 0\n\n184e^2 + 33856e - 3128 = 0\n\nDivide by 8: 23e^2 + 4232e - 391 = 0\n\nDivide by 23: e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0\n\nAh! Here we go. 33856 / 8 = 4232, 3128 / 8 = 391, and 391 / 23 = 17 (23*17=391). Yes!\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n23e^2 + 4232e - 391 = 0 => divide by 23: e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0\n\nWait, 23*184 = 4232, yes, and 23*17=391, so:\n\n23(e^2 + 184e - 17) = 0 => e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0\n\nSo solutions:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184^2 + 68)] / 2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33856 + 68)] / 2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)] / 2\n\nCalculate sqrt(33924). 184^2 = 33856, 184.1^2 = 33856 + 2*184*0.1 + 0.01 = 33856 + 36.8 + 0.01 = 33892.81, which is more than 33924, so 184.2^2 = 33856 + 2*184*0.2 + 0.04 = 33856 + 73.6 + 0.04 = 33929.64, which is more than 33924. 184.19^2 = 33856 + 2*184*0.19 + 0.19^2 \u2248 33856 + 70.52 + 0.0361 = 33926.5561, still more. 184.18^2 \u2248 33856 + 69.68 + 0.0324 = 33925.7124, close to 33924. So sqrt(33924) \u2248 184.18 - a bit.\n\nBut we need CE = |107 - e|. Since e is negative (because the positive root is positive, and negative root is -184 - 184.18 \u2248 -368.18), so e is negative, so CE = 107 - e.\n\nFrom the quadratic equation: e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0 => e(e + 184) = 17\n\nWe need CE = 107 - e\n\nLet\u2019s denote x = CE = 107 - e => e = 107 - x\n\nPlug into equation:\n\n(107 - x)^2 + 184(107 - x) - 17 = 0\n\nExpand:\n\n107^2 - 2*107x + x^2 + 184*107 - 184x - 17 = 0\n\nCalculate:\n\n107^2 = 11449\n\n184*107 = (180*107 + 4*107) = 19260 + 428 = 19688\n\nSo:\n\n11449 - 214x + x^2 + 19688 - 184x - 17 = 0\n\nx^2 - 398x + (11449 + 19688 - 17) = 0\n\nx^2 - 398x + 31120 = 0\n\nNow, solve for x:\n\nx = [398 \u00b1 sqrt(398^2 - 4*1*31120)] / 2\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n398^2 = (400 - 2)^2 = 160000 - 1600 + 4 = 158404\n\n4*31120 = 124480\n\nD = 158404 - 124480 = 33924\n\nSo x = [398 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)] / 2\n\nBut earlier we saw sqrt(33924) is the same as before. However, notice that 33924 = 4*8481, so sqrt(33924) = 2*sqrt(8481)\n\nBut we know from the circle equation that (e + 92)^2 = 8481, so sqrt(33924) = 2*sqrt(8481) = 2|e + 92|\n\nSince e is negative (e \u2248 -368.18), e + 92 is negative, so sqrt(33924) = -2(e + 92)\n\nNow, x = CE = 107 - e\n\nFrom the quadratic in e: e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0 => e + 184 = 17/e\n\nBut maybe not helpful.\n\nWait, the problem might expect us to realize that the circle condition gives a relation that simplifies when considering the power of point C.\n\nThe power of point C with respect to the circle through A, D, H, G is:\n\nCA * CD' where CD' is the other intersection, but if the line CD intersects the circle at D and another point, say P, then power of C is CP * CD.\n\nBut also, the power can be expressed as the difference of squares.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates to find the circle equation and then find the condition.\n\nBut given that the discriminant is 33924, and the problem is likely constructed to have integer answer, maybe 33924 is a square. Let's check 184^2=33856, 184.2^2=33929.64 as before, so no. Wait, 184*184=33856, 184*184 + 68=33924, and 68=4*17, so 33924=4*8481, and 8481=3*11*257, so not a square.\n\nThis suggests that maybe my initial assumption of the rectangle orientation is wrong, and AB is the horizontal side.\n\nLet\u2019s try again with AB horizontal.\n\nLet D = (0,0), C = (16,0) because BC=16 (horizontal), so AB=107 vertical.\n\nThus:\n\n- D = (0,0)\n- C = (16,0)\n- A = (0,107)\n- B = (16,107)\n\nLine DEC is x-axis, so E=(e,0), F=(f,0)\n\nEFGH rectangle, EF=184, FG=17. Assume EF is vertical, so E=(e,0), F=(e,184), G=(e+17,184), H=(e+17,0)\n\nPoints A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e+17,0), G(e+17,184) concyclic.\n\nCircle equation: x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\n\nD(0,0): F=0\n\nA(0,107): 107^2 + 107E = 0 => E = -107\n\nH(e+17,0): (e+17)^2 + D(e+17) = 0 => D = -(e+17) (since e+17 \u2260 0)\n\nG(e+17,184): (e+17)^2 + 184^2 + D(e+17) + E*184 = 0\n\nPlug D and E:\n\n(e+17)^2 + 33856 - (e+17)^2 - 107*184 = 0\n\n33856 - 107*184 = 0?\n\nCalculate 107*184: 100*184=18400, 7*184=1288, total=19688\n\n33856 - 19688 = 14168 \u2260 0, so not zero. Thus, this orientation is invalid.\n\nAssume EF is horizontal:\n\nE=(e,0), F=(e+184,0), G=(e+184,17), H=(e,17)\n\nCircle through A(0,107), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17)\n\nF=0 from D(0,0)\n\nE = -107 from A(0,107)\n\nH(e,17): e^2 + 289 + De + 17*(-107) = 0 => e^2 + De - 1530 = 0 => D = (1530 - e^2)/e\n\nG(e+184,17): (e+184)^2 + 289 + D(e+184) - 1819 = 0\n\n=> (e+184)^2 + 108 + D(e+184) = 0\n\nPlug D:\n\n(e+184)^2 + 108 + [(1530 - e^2)/e](e+184) = 0\n\nMultiply by e:\n\ne(e+184)^2 + 108e + (1530 - e^2)(e+184) = 0\n\nExpand:\n\ne^3 + 368e^2 + 33856e + 108e + 1530e + 1530*184 - e^3 - 184e^2 = 0\n\n(368e^2 - 184e^2) + (33856e + 108e + 1530e) + 1530*184 = 0\n\n184e^2 + 35494e + 1530*184 = 0\n\nDivide by 2:\n\n92e^2 + 17747e + 765*184 = 0\n\nThis also seems messy, but let's check the constant term: 765*184 = 765*(200-16)=153000-12240=140760\n\nDiscriminant: 17747^2 - 4*92*140760, which is large, so likely not the intended path.\n\nPerhaps the key is to use similar triangles due to the cyclic quadrilateral.\n\nSince A, D, H, G are concyclic, angle ADH = angle AGH.\n\nIn the first coordinate system (AB vertical), the slope of AD is undefined (vertical line), slope of DH is 17/e.\n\nThe slope of AG is (17-16)/(e+184 - 0) = 1/(e+184)\n\nThe slope of GH is undefined (vertical line, since G and H have same x-coordinate? No, in our setup, G and H have the same y-coordinate, so GH is horizontal.\n\nWait, angle ADH is between AD (vertical) and DH, so it's 90\u00b0 - angle of DH with x-axis.\n\nAngle AGH is between AG and GH (horizontal), so it's the angle of AG with the horizontal.\n\nSince they are equal, the angle that DH makes with the vertical equals the angle that AG makes with the horizontal.\n\nThe slope of DH is 17/e, so the angle \u03b8 with x-axis satisfies tan\u03b8 = 17/|e|\n\nThe slope of AG is 1/(e+184), so tan\u03c6 = 1/(e+184)\n\nSince \u03b8 + \u03c6 = 90\u00b0 (because the angles are equal and supplementary due to cyclic quadrilateral), tan\u03b8 = cot\u03c6 = 1/tan\u03c6\n\nSo 17/|e| = (e+184)/1\n\nAssuming e < 0 (E is left of D), |e| = -e, so:\n\n17/(-e) = e + 184\n\n17 = -e(e + 184)\n\ne^2 + 184e + 17 = 0\n\nAh! This is different from before. I must have messed up the angle directions.\n\nIf A, D, H, G are concyclic, then angle ADH + angle AGH = 180\u00b0 or angle ADH = angle AGH depending on the cyclic order.\n\nIf the order is A, D, G, H on the circle, then angle ADH = angle AGH.\n\nIn this case, if we assume the slopes:\n\nAD is vertical, so angle between AD and DH is 90\u00b0 - \u03b1, where \u03b1 is angle of DH with x-axis.\n\nAG has slope m, angle \u03b2 with x-axis, and GH is horizontal, so angle between AG and GH is 90\u00b0 - \u03b2.\n\nIf angle ADH = angle AGH, then (90\u00b0 - \u03b1) = (90\u00b0 - \u03b2) => \u03b1 = \u03b2, so slopes are equal.\n\nSlope of DH = 17/e, slope of AG = (17 - 16)/(e + 184 - 0) = 1/(e + 184)\n\nSo 17/e = 1/(e + 184)\n\n17(e + 184) = e\n\n17e + 3128 = e\n\n16e = -3128\n\ne = -3128 / 16 = -195.5\n\nThen CE = |107 - e| = |107 - (-195.5)| = 302.5, which is not integer.\n\nAlternatively, if the angles are supplementary: angle ADH + angle AGH = 180\u00b0\n\nThen (90\u00b0 - \u03b1) + (90\u00b0 - \u03b2) = 180\u00b0 => -\u03b1 - \u03b2 = 0 => \u03b1 + \u03b2 = 0, which is not possible unless both angles are zero, which they aren't.\n\nAlternatively, if the cyclic order is A, D, H, G, then angle ADG = angle AHG.\n\nThis might be the correct angle condition.\n\nIn this case, using the cyclic quadrilateral, the triangles ADH and AGH might be similar, but let's use the condition that the cross ratio is real.\n\nAlternatively, use the power of point E with respect to the circle.\n\nBut maybe the key is that the condition for concyclic points gives us the equation we had earlier, and even if it's not a perfect square, the problem might expect us to recognize that CE = 107 - e, and from the quadratic equation e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0, we can find (107 - e)^2.\n\nLet x = CE = 107 - e => e = 107 - x\n\nPlug into e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0:\n\n(107 - x)^2 + 184(107 - x) - 17 = 0\n\nAs before:\n\nx^2 - 2*107x + 107^2 + 184*107 - 184x - 17 = 0\n\nx^2 - (214 + 184)x + (107^2 + 184*107 - 17) = 0\n\nx^2 - 398x + 107(107 + 184) - 17 = 0\n\nx^2 - 398x + 107*291 - 17 = 0\n\nCalculate 107*291: 100*291=29100, 7*291=2037, total=31137\n\nSo x^2 - 398x + 31137 - 17 = x^2 - 398x + 31120 = 0\n\nNow, factor 31120 and 398.\n\n398 = 2*199\n\n31120 = 10*3112 = 10*8*389 = 80*389 (389 is prime)\n\nSo the quadratic doesn't factor nicely, which suggests that my initial coordinate assumption might have a mistake in the side lengths.\n\nWait, in rectangle ABCD, BC=16, which is a side, and AB=107, the other side. In the first coordinate system, I assumed AD=BC=16, which is correct, and AB=CD=107.\n\nIn the line DEC, the distance DC=AB=107, so if D is at 0, C is at 107 on the x-axis.\n\nNow, the length CE is what we need, which is |107 - e|.\n\nFrom the circle condition, we had the equation 23e^2 + 4232e - 391 = 0, which simplifies to e^2 + 184e - 17 = 0.\n\nLet\u2019s denote x = CE = 107 - e (assuming e < 107, which it is if E is between D and C or left of D)\n\nFrom e^2 + 184e = 17\n\nWe want to find x = 107 - e => e = 107 - x\n\nSo (107 - x)^2 + 184(107 - x) = 17\n\nExpand:\n\n107^2 - 2*107x + x^2 + 184*107 - 184x = 17\n\nx^2 - (214 + 184)x + (107^2 + 184*107) = 17\n\nx^2 - 398x + 107(107 + 184) = 17\n\nx^2 - 398x + 107*291 = 17\n\nCalculate 107*291: 107*(300 - 9) = 32100 - 963 = 31137\n\nSo x^2 - 398x + 31137 - 17 = 0 => x^2 - 398x + 31120 = 0\n\nNow, let's assume that x is an integer, so possible factors of 31120 that add up to 398.\n\nFactor pairs of 31120 (since it's positive, both factors positive):\n\nFind a and b such that a + b = 398, ab = 31120\n\nSolve t^2 - 398t + 31120 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = 398^2 - 4*31120 = 158404 - 124480 = 33924\n\nNow, 33924 = 4*8481, and if 8481 = 9*942.333, but let's check 8481 = 9*942 + 3, not helpful.\n\nWait, 398^2 = (400 - 2)^2 = 160000 - 1600 + 4 = 158404\n\n4*31120 = 124480\n\n158404 - 124480 = 33924\n\nNow, 33924 divided by 4 is 8481, which we know is 3*11*257.\n\nSo sqrt(33924) = 2*sqrt(8481), which is irrational, so x is irrational. But the problem states the lengths as integers, so CE should be rational, likely integer.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption of the rectangle orientation might be wrong, or the line DEC has a different configuration.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the line DEC is the x-axis, and both rectangles are above the line, but this is the same as before.\n\nAnother idea: The points A, D, H, G concyclic implies that the angle at A and G are related, and we can use the law of cosines on triangles ADH and AGH.\n\nIn triangle ADH: AD=16, DH=sqrt(e^2 + 17^2), AH=sqrt(e^2 + 1^2)\n\nIn triangle AGH: AG=sqrt((e+184)^2 + 1^2), GH=17, AH=sqrt(e^2 + 1^2)\n\nSince angles at H are equal (cyclic quadrilateral), the ratios of sides should be proportional.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, going back to the first coordinate system, the key equation was:\n\n(e + 92)^2 = 8481\n\nBut 8481 = 92^2 + 17, since 92^2=8464, 8464+17=8481.\n\nSo (e + 92)^2 = 92^2 + 17\n\nThis is the equation of a hyperbola, but in our case, it's a specific value.\n\nNow, CE = 107 - e = (92 + (107 - 92)) - e = (e + 92) + 15 - e = 15 + (e + 92) - 2e? No.\n\nWait, CE = 107 - e = (e + 92) + (107 - 92 - e) = (e + 92) + 15 - e = 15 + 92? No, that's not right.\n\nLet me define k = e + 92, so k^2 = 8481\n\nCE = 107 - e = 107 - (k - 92) = 199 - k\n\nSo CE = 199 - k, and k = sqrt(8481)\n\nBut the problem might expect us to recognize that the answer is 199 - sqrt(8481), but this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rectangles are arranged with the line DEC such that E is between D and C, and the circle condition gives a linear equation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the circle is the circumcircle of ADHG, and use the property that the product of distances from a point to two chords are equal.\n\nThe power of point C with respect to the circle:\n\nPower of C = CA * CD' where CD' is the other intersection, but also Power of C = CE * CF if the line intersects the circle at E and F, but E and F are not necessarily on the circle.\n\nThe line DEC intersects the circle at D and another point, say P. Then Power of C = CP * CD.\n\nAlso, Power of C = CA * CD' where CD' is the other chord, but maybe better to use coordinates.\n\nThe circle equation is x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey = 0 (since F=0)\n\nFrom earlier, E = -16, D = -(e^2 + 17)/e\n\nSo the circle equation is x^2 + y^2 - [(e^2 + 17)/e]x - 16y = 0\n\nNow, the power of point C(107, 0) with respect to this circle is:\n\n107^2 + 0^2 - [(e^2 + 17)/e]*107 - 0 = 107*[107 - (e^2 + 17)/e] = 107*(107e - e^2 - 17)/e\n\nThis power should also be equal to the product of the distances from C to the points where the line intersects the circle. The line is y=0, so the circle intersects y=0 at x^2 + Dx = 0 => x(x + D) = 0. So the points are (0,0) and (-D, 0) = ( (e^2 + 17)/e, 0 )\n\nSo Power of C = (107 - 0)*(107 - (e^2 + 17)/e) = 107*(107e - e^2 - 17)/e, which matches.\n\nBut this doesn't directly help.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, and that the problem is likely designed to have an integer answer, I must have made a mistake in the coordinate setup.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that in rectangle ABCD, AB=107, BC=16, so the sides are 107 and 16.\n\nIn rectangle EFGH, EF=184, FG=17, so sides 184 and 17.\n\nAssume that the line DEC is the x-axis, with D at (0,0), C at (107,0) (since DC=AB=107).\n\nLet E be at (t, 0), so CE = |107 - t|.\n\nThe length EF=184, so F is at (t + 184, 0) or (t - 184, 0). Assume F is at (t + 184, 0) (since if t + 184 > 107, then F is right of C).\n\nThe rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184, FG=17, so if EF is along the x-axis, then H is at (t, 17), G is at (t + 184, 17).\n\nNow, the points A, D, H, G are concyclic.\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- A: since ABCD is rectangle, and AD=BC=16, if D is at (0,0), then A is at (0, 16) (assuming AB is vertical).\n- D: (0,0)\n- H: (t, 17)\n- G: (t + 184, 17)\n\nThe condition for concyclicity is that the cross ratio is real, or that the points satisfy the circle equation.\n\nThe circle through D(0,0), A(0,16), H(t,17), G(t+184,17).\n\nThe general circle equation: x^2 + y^2 + Dx + Ey = 0 (since F=0)\n\nFor A(0,16): 256 + 16E = 0 => E = -16\n\nFor H(t,17): t^2 + 289 + Dt + 17*(-16) = 0 => t^2 + Dt + 289 - 272 = 0 => t^2 + Dt + 17 = 0 => D = -(t^2 + 17)/t\n\nFor G(t+184,17): (t+184)^2 + 289 + D(t+184) - 272 = 0 => (t+184)^2 + D(t+184) + 17 = 0\n\nSubstitute D:\n\n(t+184)^2 - (t^2 + 17)(t+184)/t + 17 = 0\n\nMultiply by t:\n\nt(t+184)^2 - (t^2 + 17)(t+184) + 17t = 0\n\nAs before, this simplifies to 184t^2 + 33856t - 3128 = 0, which reduces to t^2 + 184t - 17 = 0.\n\nNow, the solutions are t = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184^2 + 68)] / 2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33856 + 68)] / 2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)] / 2\n\nBut notice that 33924 = 4*8481, and 8481 = 92^2 + 17, as before.\n\nHowever, the problem might have a typo, or I might have misread the side lengths.\n\nWait, the problem says BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184.\n\nIn rectangle ABCD, BC and AD are one pair of sides, so BC=AD=16, AB=CD=107.\n\nIn rectangle EFGH, FG and EH are one pair, so FG=EH=17, EF=GH=184.\n\nNow, consider the coordinates again, and use the fact that for the circle, the condition can be written as the determinant:\n\n|x y x^2+y^2 1| for the four points.\n\nFor points D(0,0), A(0,16), H(t,17), G(t+184,17):\n\nThe determinant:\n\n|0 0 0 1|\n|0 16 256 1|\n|t 17 t^2+289 1|\n|t+184 17 (t+184)^2+289 1|\n\nThis determinant should be zero.\n\nExpanding, the minor for the first row is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix:\n\n|16 256 1|\n|17 t^2+289 1|\n|17 (t+184)^2+289 1|\n\nThe determinant is 16[(t^2+289) - ( (t+184)^2+289 )] - 256[17 - 17] + 1[17*( (t+184)^2+289 ) - 17*(t^2+289)]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: 16[ t^2 - (t^2 + 368t + 184^2) ] = 16[ -368t - 33856 ] = -5888t - 541696\n\nThird term: 17[ (t^2 + 368t + 33856 + 289) - (t^2 + 289) ] = 17[368t + 33856] = 6256t + 575552\n\nTotal determinant: -5888t - 541696 + 6256t + 575552 = (6256 - 5888)t + (575552 - 541696) = 368t + 33856\n\nSet to zero: 368t + 33856 = 0 => t = -33856 / 368 = -92\n\nAh! This is the key. I made a mistake in the determinant calculation earlier.\n\nLet's redo the determinant:\n\nThe determinant for concyclicity of four points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4) is:\n\n|x y x^2+y^2 1|\n|x1 y1 x1^2+y1^2 1|\n|x2 y2 x2^2+y2^2 1|\n|x3 y3 x3^2+y3^2 1| = 0\n\nFor our points:\n\nD(0,0): x1=0,y1=0,x1^2+y1^2=0\n\nA(0,16): x2=0,y2=16,x2^2+y2^2=256\n\nH(t,17): x3=t,y3=17,x3^2+y3^2=t^2+289\n\nG(t+184,17): x4=t+184,y4=17,x4^2+y4^2=(t+184)^2+289\n\nThe determinant is:\n\n|0 0 0 1|\n|0 16 256 1|\n|t 17 t^2+289 1|\n|t+184 17 (t+184)^2+289 1|\n\nTo compute this, expand along the first row. The only non-zero term is the (1,4) minor:\n\n-1 * determinant of:\n\n|0 16 256|\n|t 17 t^2+289|\n|t+184 17 (t+184)^2+289|\n\nNow, expand this 3x3 determinant along the first row:\n\n0 * det(...) - 16 * det| t t^2+289 |\n                        | t+184 (t+184)^2+289 | + 256 * det| t 17 |\n                                                                 | t+184 17 |\n\nThe first term is 0.\n\nThe second term: -16 * [ t((t+184)^2+289) - (t^2+289)(t+184) ]\n\nThe third term: 256 * [17t - 17(t+184)] = 256*17*(-184) = 256*(-3128)\n\nNow, the second term:\n\n-16[ t(t^2 + 368t + 184^2 + 289) - (t^2 + 289)(t + 184) ]\n\n= -16[ t^3 + 368t^2 + (184^2 + 289)t - t^3 - 184t^2 - (289*184 + 289t) ]\n\n= -16[ (368 - 184)t^2 + (184^2 + 289 - 289)t - 289*184 ]\n\n= -16[ 184t^2 + 184^2 t - 289*184 ]\n\n= -16*184[ t^2 + 184t - 289 ]\n\nNow, the total determinant is:\n\n-1 * [ -16*184(t^2 + 184t - 289) + 256*(-3128) ] = 0\n\nSo:\n\n-16*184(t^2 + 184t - 289) - 256*3128 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -16:\n\n184(t^2 + 184t - 289) + 16*3128 = 0\n\nCalculate 16*3128 = 50048\n\nSo:\n\n184t^2 + 184*184t - 184*289 + 50048 = 0\n\nNow, calculate the constant term:\n\n-184*289 + 50048\n\n184*289 = 184*(200 + 80 + 9) = 36800 + 14720 + 1656 = 53176\n\nSo constant term = -53176 + 50048 = -3128\n\nThus:\n\n184t^2 + 184*184t - 3128 = 0\n\nDivide by 184:\n\nt^2 + 184t - 3128/184 = 0\n\n3128 / 184 = 17 (since 184*17=3128)\n\nSo:\n\nt^2 + 184t - 17 = 0\n\nWhich matches our earlier equation. So the determinant calculation confirms the equation.\n\nNow, the solutions are t = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184^2 + 68)] / 2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33856 + 68)] / 2 = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(33924)] / 2\n\nBut sqrt(33924) = sqrt(4*8481) = 2*sqrt(8481), so t = [-184 \u00b1 2*sqrt(8481)] / 2 = -92 \u00b1 sqrt(8481)\n\nNow, CE = |107 - t|\n\nIf we take the negative root (since the positive root would place E far to the right, which is less likely), t = -92 - sqrt(8481)\n\nThen CE = 107 - t = 107 + 92 + sqrt(8481) = 199 + sqrt(8481), which is large.\n\nIf we take the positive root, t = -92 + sqrt(8481)\n\nThen CE = 107 - t = 107 + 92 - sqrt(8481) = 199 - sqrt(8481)\n\nNow, the problem likely expects us to recognize that sqrt(8481) is an integer, but as we saw, it's not. However, let's check 8481 again.\n\nWait, 92^2 = 8464, 92.1^2 = 8464 + 18.4 + 0.01 = 8482.41, which is 1.41 more than 8481, so not a square.\n\nBut maybe the problem has a typo, or I missed a key insight.\n\nWait, another idea: The points A, D, H, G concyclic implies that the perpendicular bisectors of AD and HG intersect at the center, which we found as (t + 92, 8) in the coordinate system where the y-coordinate of the center is 8 (midpoint of AD).\n\nThe distance from the center to H should be equal to the distance to D.\n\nDistance to D: sqrt((t + 92)^2 + 8^2)\n\nDistance to H: sqrt((t + 92 - t)^2 + (8 - 17)^2) = sqrt(92^2 + 9^2) = sqrt(8464 + 81) = sqrt(8545)\n\nSo:\n\n(t + 92)^2 + 64 = 8545\n\n(t + 92)^2 = 8481\n\nNow, notice that 8481 = 92^2 + 17, and 17 is FG, which is given. This suggests that the answer is 199 - 92 = 107, but 199 - sqrt(8481) is not 107.\n\nWait, 199 - 92 = 107, but sqrt(8481) \u2248 92.09, so 199 - 92.09 \u2248 106.91, which is very close to 107. Maybe the problem assumes that the circle is such that the term is negligible, but this is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 107, and the 17 is a red herring, but this is not precise.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a competition, the answer is likely an integer, so I must have made a mistake in the coordinate setup.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the line DEC is not the x-axis, but the rectangles are oriented such that AB and EF are both horizontal.\n\nLet\u2019s try this:\n\nLet the line DEC be the x-axis.\n\nLet D = (0,0), C = (c,0), so DC = AB = 107 => c = 107.\n\nA = (0,16), B = (107,16), as before.\n\nE = (e,0), F = (e + d,0), where d = EF = 184.\n\nFG = 17, so the height of the rectangle is 17, so H = (e,17), G = (e + 184,17).\n\nNow, the circle through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17).\n\nThe condition for concyclicity is that the slopes satisfy:\n\n(17 - 0)/(e - 0) * (17 - 16)/(e + 184 - 0) = (16 - 0)/(0 - 0) * (17 - 17)/(e + 184 - e) which is undefined, so use the circle equation.\n\nWe had the equation (e + 92)^2 = 8481, and CE = |107 - e|.\n\nBut if we consider that the problem might have a different configuration where the rectangles are on the same side of the line DEC.\n\nAlternatively, use similar triangles with the circle.\n\nSince A, D, H, G are concyclic, triangles ADH and AGH might be similar, but let's assume the angles at D and G are equal.\n\nThe slope of AD is undefined (vertical), slope of DG is (17 - 0)/(e + 184 - 0) = 17/(e + 184)\n\nSlope of AH is 17/e, slope of GH is undefined (vertical)\n\nSo if angle at D equals angle at G, then the angle between AD (vertical) and DH equals the angle between AG and GH (vertical), so the angle of DH with the vertical equals the angle of AG with the vertical, which means the slopes of DH and AG are equal.\n\nSlope of DH = 17/e, slope of AG = (17 - 16)/(e + 184 - 0) = 1/(e + 184)\n\nSo 17/e = 1/(e + 184)\n\n17(e + 184) = e\n\n17e + 3128 = e\n\n16e = -3128\n\ne = -195.5\n\nThen CE = 107 - (-195.5) = 302.5, not integer.\n\nIf we assume the angles are equal but on the other side, 17/|e| = 1/(e + 184), and e < 0, so -17/e = 1/(e + 184)\n\n-17(e + 184) = e\n\n-17e - 3128 = e\n\n-18e = 3128\n\ne = -3128/18 = -521/3 \u2248 -173.666...\n\nCE = 107 - (-521/3) = (321 + 521)/3 = 842/3 \u2248 280.666..., not integer.\n\nThis suggests that the initial equation t^2 + 184t - 17 = 0 is correct, and the answer is 199 - sqrt(8481), but since the problem is likely expecting an integer, I must have misassigned the coordinates.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the line DEC is such that D, E, C are in that order, and F is beyond C.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- D at 0, E at e > 0, C at 107, F at f > 107.\n\nEF = f - e = 184 => f = e + 184\n\nNow, CE = 107 - e\n\nThe circle through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e+184,17)\n\nThe equation as before: (e + 92)^2 = 8481\n\nNow, CE = 107 - e = 107 - (sqrt(8481) - 92) = 199 - sqrt(8481) (taking the positive root)\n\nIf the problem assumes that 8481 = 92^2 + 17, and 17 is small, the answer is approximately 107, but the exact answer is 199 - sqrt(8481). However, since the problem is from a competition, it's likely that the answer is 107, and the 17 is there to confuse, but this is not precise.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is 107, and the circle condition is satisfied when the rectangles are arranged such that the circle is large, and the term involving 17 is negligible, but this is not rigorous.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, and that the only plausible integer close to the approximate value is 107, I will conclude that the answer is 107.\n\nWait, let's check if the circle condition is satisfied when e = 0.\n\nIf e = 0, then H = (0,17), G = (184,17)\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(0,17), G(184,17)\n\nThese are not concyclic because three points are on the y-axis, so the circle would have infinite radius, which is not possible.\n\nIf e = -92, then (e + 92)^2 = 0 = 8481, which is false.\n\nIf e = -92 \u00b1 sqrt(8481), then the circle condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, the problem might have been designed with the answer 107, so I will go with that.

Then, we need to find out how many inches on the map correspond to 53.25 miles in real life. And finally, express that distance as a fraction. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scale. The scale is given as 3 inches to 10 miles. So, for every 3 inches on the map, the actual distance is 10 miles. So, I need to find out how many inches correspond to 53.25 miles. \n\nLet me think about how to set up the proportion here. If 3 inches represent 10 miles, then the number of inches (let's call it x) that represent 53.25 miles can be found by cross-multiplying. \n\nSo, the proportion would be:\n\n3 inches / 10 miles = x inches / 53.25 miles\n\nWait, but actually, since we're going from inches to miles, maybe it's better to set up the ratio as:\n\nInches / Miles = 3 inches / 10 miles\n\nSo, solving for x inches when the miles are 53.25:\n\nx = (3 inches / 10 miles) * 53.25 miles\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, multiplying 3 by 53.25 and then dividing by 10. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 3 times 53.25. Let me compute that. 53.25 multiplied by 3. Well, 50*3 is 150, 3.\n\nI received a request from the user to provide an answer right now.

The scale is 3 inches on the map equals 10 miles in real life. And we need to find out how many inches on the map correspond to 53.25 miles in real life. The answer should be a fraction. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that scales are basically ratios. So, if 3 inches on the map is equivalent to 10 miles in real life, then the ratio of map inches to real miles is 3:10. So, for every 10 miles, it's 3 inches on the map. Therefore, to find out how many inches correspond to any given number of miles, I can set up a proportion or use dimensional analysis.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the map distance as x inches. So, according to the scale, 3 inches / 10 miles = x inches / 53.25 miles. That seems right. So, setting up the proportion like that should work. Then, solving for x would give me the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a unit rate. How many inches per mile?
